<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>JESSICA DISAPPEARS</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Benton and Jessica were upon the south
porch of the Sobrante ranch house, the former busy
as usual, the latter idly enjoying her charming surroundings
as she swung to and fro in her hammock.</p>
<p>Mighty vines of pale yellow roses, intermingled
with climbing fuchsias, cast shade and sweetness
over them; the porch was bordered by a wide swath
of calla lilies, also in full flower, while just beyond
these a great shrub of poinsettia dazzled the sight
with its gleaming blossoms.</p>
<p>When a momentary silence of the other&rsquo;s nimble
tongue allowed her to speak, Jessica exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sally, you&rsquo;re the only person I know who
can do three things at once. You sew as fast as
you rock, and talk faster than either. You&rsquo;re a
very clever woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady answered complacently, as she bit
off a fresh needleful of thread and looked at her
companion over her spectacles:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearie, I expect I am. I can do more&rsquo;n that,
too. I can keep up a powerful thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How that life is a patchwork quilt. All the
colors of the rainbow, and some that any self-respectin&rsquo;
rainbow would scorn to own. Some
scraps so amazing homely you hate to put &rsquo;em in,
but just have to, else there wouldn&rsquo;t be blocks
enough to square it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a scrap am I, Aunt Sally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Fair to middlin&rsquo;. Neither very light, nor
very dark. You&rsquo;d be prettier, to my notion, if you&rsquo;d
fetch a needle and thread and sew a seam with me,
&rsquo;stead of swinging yourself dizzy out of pure
laziness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Aunt Sally! I call that unkind! I hate to
sew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you. You&rsquo;ll never put a stitch where a
pin will do. But, never mind. If everybody else
sets out to spoil you, I don&rsquo;t know as it&rsquo;s my call to
interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was so much tenderness in the glance that
accompanied these words that nobody could resent
them; least of all the girl, who now sprang from
the hammock and curled herself at the other&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me those powerful thoughts, auntie, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Benton sighed, but responded nothing loath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your mother, Gabriella. Only child,
left an orphan, raised by a second cousin once
removed, who&rsquo;d more temper than sense, and when
your mother fell in love with your father, who&rsquo;d
more goodness than cash, shut the door on them
both forthwith. So off they come to Californy and
pitch their tent right here in the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a lovelier place,&rdquo; their
daughter answered, with a sweeping glance over the
fair land which formed her home.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough. Then him getting that
New York company to buy Paraiso d&rsquo;Oro Valley,
so&rsquo;s a lot of folks that was down in the world could
come out here and live in it. Poor Cass&rsquo;us dying,
just as he&rsquo;d got things to his liking; the losing of
the title deed and your journeying to Los Angeles
to get it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not &lsquo;lost,&rsquo; Aunt Sally. Poor Antonio hid it at
El Desierto, in the cave of the Three Rocks. He&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s foot! Don&rsquo;t you go to &lsquo;pooring&rsquo; that snaky
sneak, or you and me&rsquo;ll fall out. I should hate
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I. But you&rsquo;ve set me thinking, too.
How wonderful that Mr. Ninian Sharp was, the
newspaper man. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for him, we&rsquo;d
never have won that battle. What could I have
done, with Ephraim Marsh in the hospital, and I
knowing nothing about the city? That Mr. Hale
was another splendid man. I can understand how
he had to keep his word and do his best for the
company which thought father had wronged it;
and I can also understand that he was as glad as
we to find their money safe with the poor banker
who was killed, Luis Garcia&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pooring&rsquo; again are you? Another scamp, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Sally! He&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;dead!&rdquo; remonstrated
Jessica, in awestruck tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a fine job he is. There&rsquo;s plenty of good-for-noughts
still living. A man that&rsquo;s been wicked
all his life ain&rsquo;t apt to turn saint at the end of it.
I like folks that do their duty as they go along. If
the robber, Garcia, had got well he&rsquo;d likely claimed
our Luis and reared him to be as bad as himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sally, you&rsquo;re uncharitable this morning.
What&rsquo;s made you so?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The plumb meanness of human natur&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own?&rdquo; asked the girl teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, saucebox. My boy, John&rsquo;s. His, and all
the rest of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t toward anybody, out and out. If it
was I&rsquo;d roll up my sleeves and switch the lot of &rsquo;em,
just as if they were the little tackers they act like.
It&rsquo;s them pesky hints and shrugged shoulders, every
time the Dutch Winklers or &lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo; is spoke
of. I wish to goodness that man&rsquo;d come home and
clear his name, or give me a chance to do it. He no
more stole that knitting-woman&rsquo;s money than I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sally! Stole? Stole! My Ephraim!
Why, you must be crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, it&rsquo;s out. Needn&rsquo;t hop up like that, mad
as a hornet, at me. I&rsquo;m not the one hints and
shrugs. It&rsquo;s the whole lot of your precious &lsquo;boys&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;boys;
indeed! and needing spanking more&rsquo;n they
ever did in their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessica&rsquo;s swift pacing of the wide porch came to
a sudden halt, and she dropped down again at Mrs.
Benton&rsquo;s feet, feeling as if the floor had given way
beneath her tread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, then, was what my mother meant, that very
day when I came back, that Ephraim was happier
where he was! The dear old fellow; thrown to the
street by his graceless Stiffleg; picked up with a
leg full of broken bones; a prisoner in a hospital
all these weeks; giving all his savings of years to
us; and the &lsquo;boys&rsquo; he&rsquo;s lived with since before I was
born accusing him of&ndash;&ndash;theft! Aunt Sally, it&rsquo;s too
monstrous to be true!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis, indeedy. Seem&rsquo;s if the Evil One had been
let loose, here at Sobrante, when the word of a
half-wit&ndash;&ndash;poor half, at that&ndash;&ndash;is held proof against
the entire life of an honest old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Sally was so deeply moved that, for once,
she allowed herself a moment&rsquo;s respite from unceasing
industry, unconsciously holding a patchwork
block to her moist eyes, and slowly swaying the
great rocker as she sorrowfully reflected that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I raised him the best I could, that boy John. I
gave him a pill once a week, regular, to keep his
bile down. I washed him every Saturday night and
spanked him after I got through. I never let him
eat butter when he had gravy, and I made him say
his prayers night and morning. I had a notion that
such wholesome rearin&rsquo; would turn him out a decent
man; and now, just see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of her own distress, Jessica laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sally, if anybody but yourself hinted that
John wasn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;decent&rsquo; man you&rsquo;d do something
dreadful to punish the slanderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I should? Wouldn&rsquo;t I have a right? Ain&rsquo;t
he my own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessica smiled faintly, but sat for a long time
silent. The talkative woman in the rocker also kept
silence, brooding over many things. Finally she
burst forth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why it is that just as soon as a body
gets into smooth sailing, along comes a storm and
upsets things again. There was your mother, beginning
to feel she could go ahead and do what her
husband wanted to, and now here&rsquo;s this bad feeling
among her trusted hired men. Suspicion is the
pisenest yarb that grows. The folks that could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
suspect old &lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo; of wrong things&rsquo;ll be plumb
ready to watch out for one another. Somebody&rsquo;ll
be caught nappin&rsquo;, sure. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t in human natur&rsquo;
to walk upright all the time, and it&rsquo;s foolish to
expect it. But&ndash;&ndash;shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I&rsquo;d be the next
one accused. And it comin&rsquo; Christmas time too.
Land! I&rsquo;m so bestead I&rsquo;ve sewed that patch in
wrong side up. What? Hey? You laughin&rsquo;? I
don&rsquo;t see anything funny in this business, myself,&rdquo;
said the old lady, fretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would if you could look in a glass! Your
face is all streaked purple and green, where you cried
on your patch,&rdquo; explained Jessica, whose grief had
changed to amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! I knew them colors&rsquo;d run. John
fetched the piece from Marion, last time he went
for the mail. Of the two stores there, I don&rsquo;t know
which is the worst. Their &lsquo;Merrimac&rsquo; won&rsquo;t wash,
and their flannel shrinks, and their thread breaks
every needleful. But, to &lsquo;Boston&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;dear me! Whatever
did make me think of that place! Now I&rsquo;ve
thought, it&rsquo;ll stick in my mind till it drives me wild&ndash;&ndash;or
back there, and that&rsquo;s about the same thing. To
go live with that slimsy cousin of mine, after being
in the same house with your mother, is like falling
off a roof into a squashy mud puddle. That&rsquo;s all the
sense and substance there is to Sarah, that was a
Harrison before she was a Ma&rsquo;sh. I warrant she&rsquo;s
clean out of medicine an money, for she&rsquo;s a regular
squanderer when it comes to makin&rsquo; rag rugs. I
wish you could see &rsquo;em! I just wish&rsquo;t you could.
Such dogs and cats as she weaves into &rsquo;em would
have druv&rsquo; Noah plumb crazy if he had to take &rsquo;em
into the Ark. Their eyes are just round rings of
white, with another round ring of black in the
middle&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t rings always round, auntie, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they ain&rsquo;t. Not after they&rsquo;ve been trod on!&rdquo;
was the swift retort, as the old lady pointed downwards
toward the floor of the porch.</p>
<p>Both stooped and rose again, astonishment deepening
upon their faces as Jessica held out her open
palm with the injured trinket lying upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsa Winkler&rsquo;s wedding ring! How came it
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How indeed? I don&rsquo;t believe that woman&rsquo;s been
on these premises since I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if she had, Aunt Sally, why should she bring
the ring with her? It was always too small for her,
and she never had it on except during the marriage
ceremony. I&rsquo;ve often heard her laugh about it;
how Wolfgang bought a ring as big as his money
would pay for, and let it go at that. She didn&rsquo;t see
what difference it made whether it went only on the
tip of her finger or all the way down it. But she
must have been here, even if we didn&rsquo;t know it. I&rsquo;ll
take it straight to mother to keep. Then, too, I&rsquo;ve
idled enough. I promised my dear I&rsquo;d write all her
Christmas invitations for her, because she says it
will save her the trouble, and be such a help to my
education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas! Well, well. Does seem as if I
couldn&rsquo;t leave before then, nohow. And hear me,
Jessie, darlin&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t you let your poor ma worry
her head over your book learning. Being she was
a schoolma&rsquo;am herself makes her feel as if she
wasn&rsquo;t doing the square thing by you letting you
run wild, so to speak. If the Lord means you to get
schoolin&rsquo; He&rsquo;ll put you in the right way of it, don&rsquo;t
you doubt. Who all does Gabriella set out to ask
here to visit?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hale, of course; and dear Mr. Sharp. I hope
Ephraim will be well enough to come, too. Then
there are the Winklers, from the mine; the McLeods,
from their inn at Marion; and, maybe&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ve
never had a Christmas without him&ndash;&ndash;maybe
poor Antonio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I say is&ndash;&ndash;if you ask him you needn&rsquo;t
ask me. There wouldn&rsquo;t be room on this whole
ranch for the pair of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, of course, it&rsquo;s you first. Yet, it&rsquo;s all so
puzzling to me. If it&rsquo;s a time of &lsquo;peace and good
will,&rsquo; why do people keep on feeling angry with one
another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jessica Trent, dast you stand there and look
me in the face and say that you have forgive that
sneaky snakey manager for cheating your mother
like he did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was sorry, Aunt Sally. Every letter he sends
here tells that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s punished, isn&rsquo;t he, even if the New York
folks let him go free, by his disappointment? I can
fancy how dreadful it would seem, did seem to think
this beautiful ranch was one&rsquo;s own, and then suddenly
to learn that it was not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Jessie! You try my soul with your forgivin&rsquo;
and forgivin&rsquo;. Next you know you&rsquo;ll be sorry for
Ferd, the dwarf, though &rsquo;tis he himself what&rsquo;s started
all this bobery against &lsquo;Forty-niner,&rsquo; and eggs them
silly Winklers on to be so&ndash;&ndash;so hateful. I&rsquo;m glad
that witless woman did lose her ring, and I hope
it&rsquo;ll never be straightened out. I guess I&rsquo;m out
of conceit with everybody living, not exceptin&rsquo;
old Sally Benton, herself!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>With this home thrust at her own ill temper, the
whimsical woman betook herself and her dangling
array of patchwork to Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s sitting-room;
there to discuss the prospects for holiday festivities
and to take account of stock, in the way of groceries
on hand. Deep in the subject of pies and puddings,
they forgot other matters, till a wild whoop outside
the window disturbed them, and they beheld Ned
and Luis, painted in startling &ldquo;Indian fashion,&rdquo;
mounted upon a highly decorated horse, which had
never been seen in the Sobrante stables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there, mother! Your money or your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money&ndash;&ndash;life!&rdquo; echoed Luis, clinging to his playmate&rsquo;s
waist and peeping over his shoulder.</p>
<p>The horse was rearing and plunging more dangerously
each second, and both women rushed to
the rescue of the imperiled children, who realized
nothing of their danger, but shouted and screamed
the louder the more frantic their steed became.
Mrs. Trent caught the bridle, and Aunt Sally snatched
first one, then the other, child from the creature&rsquo;s
back, who, as soon as he was relieved of his yelling
burden, started at a gallop across the garden, ruining
its beds and borders on his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh! Children, how could you? Whose
horse is that? Where did you get that paint?
How shall I ever make you clean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tend to that part, Gabriella. You just call
a boy to fix them flower beds before the plants
wither. Oh, you rascals! You won&rsquo;t forget this
morning&rsquo;s fun in a hurry, I warn you! You&rsquo;ve been
in John Benton&rsquo;s paint pots again. Well, you like
paint, you shall have it, and all you want of it too.
Red and yeller, green and pink, with a streak of
blue. H&rsquo;m! You&rsquo;re a tasty lot, ain&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>The lads squirmed and twisted, but Aunt Sally&rsquo;s
grip merely tightened upon them so that finally,
they ceased struggling and allowed her to lead
them whither she would, which was to the small
laundry, that stood at some slight distance from
the house. Here she sternly regarded each bedaubed,
but otherwise nude, little figure, with so
fierce an expression upon her usually pleasant face
that the young miscreants winced, and Ned cried
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit a-talking eyes at me that way, Aunt Sally
Benton! I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you don&rsquo;t, eh? Well, what&rsquo;d you disgrace
yourselves this way for, if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t to make folks
stare? Where&rsquo;s your clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then I&rsquo;ll help you to remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be whipped! I&rsquo;ll tell my mother!&rdquo;
shrieked Ned, retreating toward the closed door
of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be whipped, old Aunt Sally!&rdquo; added Luis,
clasping his leader; whereupon the customary
scuffle ensued; for, no matter what their business
in hand, personal contact always insured a slight
passage at arms. At present, this diverted their
thoughts from what might be in store at the will of
their mutual enemy, and it came with appalling suddenness.
Each small boy was lifted, bidden to shut
his eyes and mouth, then plunged downward into a
barrel of some cold slippery stuff. Here he was
soused vigorously up and down, until every portion
of his skin was smeared with the stick mess; after
which he was placed on his feet and once more commanded:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, son, just you stand there and dreen a spell.
Lucky I made that barrel of soft soap last week.
It&rsquo;s just the stuff to take this paint off, and what
drips from you to the old adobe floor won&rsquo;t hurt.
Pasqual&rsquo;s a master hand at scrubbin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ll give
him the job of you and the floor both. Reckon
you&rsquo;ll wish you hadn&rsquo;t ever seen paint pots time
he gets through. Now&ndash;&ndash;where&rsquo;s your clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned was silent, but Luis &ldquo;guessed they&rsquo;s under
a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, son, Garcia, knowing it better than guessing
&rsquo;bout now. Me and Santa Claus is sort of partners,
and he&rsquo;s due here soon. &rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t take me a
jerk of a lamb&rsquo;s tail to write and tell him how things
stand at Sobrante, and whose stockings&rsquo;d better
have switches &rsquo;stead of goodies in &rsquo;em. Hear me?
Where&rsquo;s your clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A laugh caused Aunt Sally to glance through the
window, where Jessica was an amused spectator of
the scene within. She now begged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard on the little tackers, auntie, dear.
That was Prince, Mr. Hale&rsquo;s horse, that Pedro has
tended on the mesa all these days. I&rsquo;ll find out how
they came by it, and their clothes at the same time.
Tell mother, please,&rdquo; and with a merry nod to the
unhappy urchins, so shamfacedly &ldquo;dreening&rdquo; at Mrs.
Benton&rsquo;s pleasure, she disappeared.</p>
<p>Disappeared not only from the window, but,
apparently, from life, as suddenly and completely
as if the earth had opened and engulfed her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE HUSH OF ANXIETY</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Trent and Aunt Sally sat down alone to
dinner. The little lads were in their beds, recovering
from the sound scrubbing Pasqual had given
them. Clothed in fresh nightgowns, and refreshed
by generous bowls of bread and milk, they had been
left in a darkened room to reflect upon the hard
ways of transgressors. But reflection was unusual
work for their active brains, and they had promptly
fallen asleep; hence the profound peace which
rested upon the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where Jessica is? She was to have
written my letters for me, but I haven&rsquo;t seen her
since breakfast,&rdquo; said the mother, somewhat anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! she&rsquo;s around somewhere. Was at the laundry
window while I was tending to the children,
and said she&rsquo;d go find their clothes. In all my born
days I never saw two small heads could hatch the
mischief Ned&rsquo;s and Luis&rsquo; can. It&rsquo;s out of one scrape
into another, and seems if they must break their
necks some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t forecast evil. Their pranks keep my
nerves on tension all the time, yet I shouldn&rsquo;t worry
so. They always escape from harm. But I&rsquo;d like
to know how they got that horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I. They must have had help painting
it. Stands to reason two midgets like them couldn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
have kept a high-spirited creatur&rsquo; quiet while they
wasted enough good paint on him to cover a meeting
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John won&rsquo;t be pleased. He&rsquo;s so careful of his
belongings, even I never touch them without permission,&rdquo;
said the ranch mistress, smiling afresh at the
memory of the ridiculous picture the boys had
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t surprise me&rsquo;t you laugh, Gabriella, but
you&rsquo;d ought to put the reins on tighter to them
chaps, lest first you know they&rsquo;ll be driving you,
not you them. Do it already, seems if.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I be stern with Cassius&rsquo; little son?
Every day I see more resemblance to his father in
the childs face; yes, and in his nature, too. Nobody
was ever fonder of fun than my husband, yet surely
there never was a better man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Neddy&rsquo;s all right. Trouble is to keep him
from thinkin&rsquo; so himself. But, there. Why don&rsquo;t
you eat your dinner? You haven&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n half
touched it. It&rsquo;s a shame to waste good victuals, and
these are good. I fixed &rsquo;em myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other smiled again at the complacency visible
upon her friend&rsquo;s face, which so innocently dsplayed
the same feeling that had just been deplored in Ned.
However, Aunt Sally was too busy with her own
food to notice anything else, and it seemed long to
her companion before she had finished and risen, to
call, sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pas-qual! Oh, Pasqual-ly! Why aren&rsquo;t you on
hand to clear the table? Don&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;ve got&ndash;&ndash;and
here followed a long list of things to be done,
more than many could accomplish in several days.&rdquo;
Each had some reference to the coming holidays,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
and the house boy understood this. He entered,
more willingly than usual, grinning with the anticipation
of the raisins he would have to stone, the
nuts he must crack, and the goodly samples of each
that he would surreptitiously procure.</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent asked him to put aside Miss Jessica&rsquo;s
dinner, till she came in, and to be sure that it was
also kept nice and warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, lady. I&rsquo;ll do that good enough. Don&rsquo;t
mind what I has to do for &lsquo;Lady Jess&rsquo;;&rdquo; and immediately
seized the plate, which Aunt Sally had
already filled, to place it in the warming oven.</p>
<p>Then the mother went out, and among the adobe
buildings, which formed the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; quarters and
the business part of the ranch, calling gently, as she
went, in the brooding sort of note which had long
been a signal between her and her child. But no
Jessica responded; and, to her fancy, it seemed that
the whole place was strangely silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, that is not to be wondered at. The
men are done with dinner, and gone about their
work. The boys are asleep, and only Jessica would
be anywhere near. What can keep her, I wonder?&rdquo;
and with this thought the lady again uttered the
tender call which would summon her daughter, if
she were within hearing.</p>
<p>Then she returned to the house and tried to accept
Aunt Sally&rsquo;s theory that, likely some of them &lsquo;boys&rsquo;
is in trouble about his job, and wants his &lsquo;captain&rsquo; to
go oversee. &rsquo;Mazin&rsquo; strange, Gabriella, what a influence
that child has over &rsquo;em. &ldquo;They &rsquo;pear to think,
the whole lot of &rsquo;em, that she can straighten out
all the kinks that get into brains or business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is quick to understand,&rdquo; said the mother,
proudly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Course. Nothin&rsquo; strange, is it, seeing who her
folks was? Best go take a nap, honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Thank you for suggesting it, but I&rsquo;m
too wakeful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll fetch them kerns and citron right
out here on the kitchen porch. The sun&rsquo;s off it now,
and there ain&rsquo;t a prettier spot on earth where to
prepare Christmas fixin&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll fetch the raisins and
stone &rsquo;em myself. That Pasky boy&rsquo;d eat more&rsquo;n
half of &rsquo;em, if I left &rsquo;em to him. Then we can visit
right sociable; and I can free my mind. The truth
is, Gabriella Trent, that I ought to be harnessin&rsquo;
Rosetty an&rsquo; Balaam this minute, and be startin&rsquo; for
&lsquo;Boston.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Sally!&rdquo; protested the ranch mistress,
in real distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, dearie, hush! Don&rsquo;t worry. I said &lsquo;I
ought,&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t say I was goin&rsquo;. Seem&rsquo;s if I couldn&rsquo;t
just tear myself away from Sobrante. If Sarah
Ma&rsquo;sh, she that was a Harrison, and married
Methuel, hasn&rsquo;t got gumption enough to bile her
own plum puddin&rsquo;, I &rsquo;most feel as if she&rsquo;d ought to
go without. Though I don&rsquo;t know as that&rsquo;s real
Christian in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Benton, I wish everybody was as
sincere a Christian as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her surprise, Aunt Sally tipped her rocker so
far back that she just escaped upset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Gabriella Trent! Me! Me! Don&rsquo;t say
that, and make me feel meaner&rsquo;n dirt. It&rsquo;s you,
honey, is that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent laughed as she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We make a mutual admiration society, don&rsquo;t we?
But Aunt Sally, you mustn&rsquo;t think of leaving Sobrante
before the holidays are past. I can&rsquo;t spare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
you. I need the help of your head, as well as your
hands, and what would Christmas be to the children,
if you weren&rsquo;t here to cuddle and scold them after
their greediness has made them ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, child, say no more. Here I am, and
here I&rsquo;ll stay, if Sarah Ma&rsquo;sh don&rsquo;t get a stiver of
pudding or fowl. Here, honey, I reckon you best
slice this citron. You&rsquo;ve got a dainty hand for such
work and&ndash;&ndash;my sake&rsquo;s alive! That fruit cake&rsquo;d
ought to been made weeks ago, if it was to get any
sort of ripeness into it before it was et! Hurry up,
do. We haven&rsquo;t a minute to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This adjuration had the good result of amusing
Mrs. Trent so that, for an hour at least, she forgot
to be anxious over her daughter&rsquo;s unexplained absence.
Aunt Sally was a person who was always
&ldquo;driven to death&rdquo; by the mere thought of tasks
for which there was, in reality, ample time. But
now that she had decided to remain at the ranch
for a further indefinite stay, her spirits rose and her
brain busied itself with a thousand plans for the
comfort or amusement of the household, over which
she domineered, yet so ardently loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got much money for presents, I
know. So I&rsquo;ll just get out the piece-bag to-night,
and press off them canton flannel scraps. They&rsquo;ll
make splended ducks for the youngsters&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that would be wasted labor, friend. The
little lads have outgrown homemade toys. Nothin
that will not make a noise is acceptable to them.
I&rsquo;d thought of sending over to Marion for drums and
whistles, if the stores there can furnish them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Gabriella Trent! I declare you are the
benightenest woman that ever set out to raise children!
Drums! For them two? My, my! But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
what won&rsquo;t a mother do for her little ones, I&rsquo;d like
to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were no sooner out of Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s
mouth than she regretted them. At the name of
&ldquo;mother&rdquo; Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s forced gayety vanished, and
she lifted her eyes to her companion&rsquo;s face with a
pitiful appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sally, what has happened to Jessica?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, honey. Nothing in the world. What
a master hand you are to worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady rose so hastily that the dish upon her
lap slid to the floor, and the other laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Gabriel, you do beat all. If I&rsquo;d dropped
that dish &rsquo;twould have upset, and every slice of
citron in it rolled whithrety-yonder. But for you&ndash;&ndash;it
knew better; just slipped off as slick as could be,
landed right side up, and not a morsel scattered.
Seem&rsquo;s if dirt nor nothin&rsquo; disorderly ever could come
a-nigh you, honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent did not even hear. Upon her face
had grown a look that hurt Aunt Sally to see; the
more because the feeling it expressed was continually
increasing within her own heart.</p>
<p>Where could Jessica be? Many hours had passed
since she vanished from the laundry window, and
if she had gone upon any errand for her &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; she
would have returned long since. Also, she would
be swift to restore the missing clothes of the little
boys, as soon as found, for she knew they would
be prisoners within doors till she had done so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, I tell you, Gabriella. I&rsquo;ll take
the great horn and blow a blast will fetch the whole
kerboodle back here, hot foot. If that don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll
ring the mission bell! That&rsquo;ll mean trouble, sure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
enough, and its dreadful racket&rsquo;ll reach clear to
Los Angeles, &rsquo;pears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother crossed to the lattice and leaned
against its post. Something was wrong with her
darling. She knew that as well as if she had been
told so by word of mouth, and a dreadful numbness
stole over her whole frame. As if in a dream, she
saw Aunt Sally emerge from the lean-to, where the
great horn was kept, and raised the thing to her
lips; but the blast which followed seemed to have
been ringing in her ears forever. The silence that
succeeded lasted but a moment, yet was like an
eternity. Then from one direction, and another,
came the ranchmen, understanding that there was
need of their presence at the &ldquo;house,&rdquo; and each
quickly catching something of the fear so plainly
depicted upon the faces of the waiting women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Benton, where&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lady Jess&rsquo;?&rdquo; demanded
Aunt Sally, with terrible sternness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, how should I know? I was off to
the lemon house early, fixing some shelves. I
haven&rsquo;t seen her to-day and it makes it a long one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Came &ldquo;Marty&rdquo; from his garden, a hoe over one
shoulder and a mighty vine of ripened tomatoes over
the other, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this for a second year&rsquo;s growth? I
thought you&rsquo;d like &rsquo;em for catsup, Aunt Sally, and
what&rsquo;s the horn for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George Ceomarty, where&rsquo;s the &lsquo;captain&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t! You don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. How should I? Last I saw, she was sitting
the porch along with you. You needn&rsquo;t glare at
me so, but say yourself: &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the &ldquo;captain&rdquo;?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, gardener, this ain&rsquo;t a time for foolin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disdained to answer, reading the anxiety upon
his mistress&rsquo; face, and feeling an unaccountable one
growing in his own mind.</p>
<p>It was a relief to all when the figure of Sailor
Samson came into view, making for the cottage
with those firm strides of his, that seemed to cover
the distance with incredible speed. He was always
to be depended upon in an emergency, and there
was good cheer in his tones, as, having been asked
the same question which had greeted his mates, he
tossed back the light answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know just at this minute, but I&rsquo;ll
wager wherever she is, she&rsquo;s doing good to somebody,
or finishing up some fellow&rsquo;s neglected job. Why?
Ain&rsquo;t scared of &lsquo;Lady Jess,&rsquo; are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we are, herder. She&rsquo;s no hand
to run off an&rsquo; stay off without tellin&rsquo; where to; and
if she couldn&rsquo;t find the children&rsquo;s clothes she&rsquo;d been
back before now to say so. Somethin&rsquo; dreadful has
happened to the precious girl, and you needn&rsquo;t say
there hasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Benton; adding in fresh
dismay as the ranch mistress quietly sank to the
floor in a faint! &ldquo;There! Now I have done it! Oh!
that tongue of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, old woman! That tongue of yours&rsquo; has
wrought a heap of mischief in its day,&rdquo; cried Samson,
angrily, as he lifted the fallen lady and carried
her into the house.</p>
<p>But Aunt Sally was quite herself again, and put
him coolly aside, while she ministered to the unconscious
ranch mistress, and, at the same time, gave
him a succinct history of the morning&rsquo;s events.
Everybody at Sobrante knew the deep devotion of
Lady Jess to her widowed mother, and the thoughtfulness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
with which she always sought to prevent her
loved one&rsquo;s &ldquo;worrying,&rdquo; and all realized that there
might be something seriously amiss in this protracted,
unexplained absence. However, and to a certain
degree, the child was allowed to be independent,
and she was liable to reappear at any moment and to
gibe at their &ldquo;foolish fear&rdquo; for her. But to summon
her, at once, was the surest way of comforting Mrs.
Trent, and Samson went out again to distribute the
assembled ranchmen into searching parties, with
the injunction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t scare the &lsquo;captain&rsquo; when you find her, but
just let her know her mother needs her, and her
dinner&rsquo;s drying up in the oven. Now scatter; and
don&rsquo;t you show a face back here without her in
hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t all of us find her, herder. Ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;captains&rsquo;
enough to go &rsquo;round,&rdquo; said a cowboy, with an ill-attempt
at playfulness, which was instantly frowned
down. For, though all assured themselves that
there was no substantial cause for alarm, and that
women were &ldquo;nervous cattle, always scared at shadders,&rdquo;
they had already caught something of this
nervousness. Each felt that the best sight for his
eyes at that moment would be the gleam of a golden
head, and the sweetest music his ears could hear
the sound of a young girl&rsquo;s laughter.</p>
<p>But, alas! Daylight gave place to the sudden
night of that region, where no lingering twilight is
known; and still over the great ranch there rested
the terrible silence which had followed the loss of
one merry voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>OLD CENTURY TAKES THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>The clatter of horse&rsquo;s hoofs on the dry sward made
Pedro, the shepherd, lift his eyes from his basket
weaving, but only for an instant. The sight of
Samson, the herder, mounted upon the fleetest
animal of the Sobrante stables, was nothing compared
to the working out of the intricate pattern
he had set himself to follow. Even the centenarian,
dwelling in his lofty solitude, knew that there was
approaching the blessed Navidad, whereon all good
Christians exchanged gifts, in memory of the great
gift the Son of God; and what could he do but put
forth his utmost ingenuity to please his heart&rsquo;s
dearest, even Jessica of the sunny face?</p>
<p>Like Aunt Sally, at the ranch, he had, at last,
caught a feeling of haste and wished not to be disturbed;
so he did not even look up again when he
was accosted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, old man! Hard at it, still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No reply forthcoming, Samson shouted, as if the
shepherd were deaf:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Capt. Jess, abuleo (grandfather)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deferential title won the attention which the
loud voice could not gain, and Pedro glanced carelessly
upon the mighty herder, a mere youth of
sixty summers, and replied, with equal carelessness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I the nina&rsquo;s<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[A]</a> keeper? But, no,&rdquo; then resumed
his weaving.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>In another instant the delicate, finely split rushes
had been snatched from the weaver&rsquo;s hands, and he
exhorted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all that&rsquo;s great, old man! Tell me, has Jessica
Trent passed this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why for? Once, but once, since the long journey
and the finding of that bad Antonio came she
to Pedro&rsquo;s hut. Give back the basket. For her,
of the bright hair, it is; my finest, and, maybe, my
last. Why not? Yet still again I will keep the
fiesta, si. The child. Many have I loved, but none
like my little maid. The basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a long speech for the silent dweller on
the mesa, and there was more of anger in his usually
calm eyes than Samson had never seen there, as he
rose and extended his skinny hands for his treasure.</p>
<p>The herder restored it, his heart growing heavier
as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think fast, good Pedro. The old are wise, and
hark ye! These many hours the child is from home.
The mistress&ndash;&ndash;you love her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my mistress,&rdquo; answered the shepherd, in
a tone which conveyed all his deep feeling. To him
his &ldquo;mistress&rdquo; represented a material Providence.
From her hand came all the simple necessaries of
his life. From her, on the approaching nativity,
would also come some things which were not necessaries,
but infinitely more precious to the centenarian
than such could be. On the nativity he would
be sent, upon the gentlest mount his lady owned,
to the mission service which he loved. Thereafter
he would ride back to Sobrante, his own priest beside
him, to feast his fill on such food as he tasted
but once a year. At nightfall of that blessed day
he would gather the ranchmen about him, in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
old corridor where once he had seen the ancient
padres walk, breviary in hand, and tell his marvelous
tales of the days when the land was new, when
whole tribes of redfaces came to be taught at the
padres&rsquo; feet, and when the things which now were
had not been dreamed of. Some who listened to
these Christmas stories believed that the secrets
at which the shepherd hinted were vagaries of his
enfeebled mind, but others, and among them Samson,
gave credence to them, and yearly did their
best to worm from him their explanation.</p>
<p>That mention of the &ldquo;mistress&rdquo; had touched him,
also, to anxiety, and he motioned the herder to
repeat his statement. He then straightened himself
to almost the erectness of the younger man,
and begun at once to gather his rushes and rap them
carefully in a moistened cloth. With an expressive
gesture toward his cabin, he suggested that Samson
was free to enter it and provide such entertainment
for himself as he chose, or could find. And so well
did the herder know the shepherd that he fully understood
this significant wave of the hand, and replied
to it in words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, old man, but some other time. At present
I&rsquo;m keener on the scent for my captain than
for even your good coffee. If she comes, report,
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other did not notice what he heard, but himself
proceeded to the cabin and safely deposited his
handiwork within it. Then he came out again,
whistled for his dog, Keno, whose head he stroked
for some time, and into whose attentive ear he seemed
to be whispering some instruction.</p>
<p>A shade of amusement, merging into wonder,
crossed the herder&rsquo;s countenance, and he communed
with himself thus:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Blow my stripes, if Old Century isn&rsquo;t going to
take the trail himself! He&rsquo;s telling that canine
what to do while he&rsquo;s gone, and, ahoy, there! If
the knowin&rsquo; creatur&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t understand him! All
right, grand sir! Yet, not all so right, either. It
takes a deal of business to move Pedro off his mesa,
and if he&rsquo;s riled enough to leave it now, it&rsquo;s because
he sees more danger to Lady Jess than even I do.
Hello! what&rsquo;s he waiting for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently for Samson to depart, which that gentleman
presently did, grimly considering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old chap thinks the whole mesa belongs to him,
and &rsquo;pears to suspect I might rob him if he left me
behind. Well, friend, I&rsquo;ve no call to tarry. Since
my lady isn&rsquo;t here, I must seek her elsewhere,&rdquo; and
down the canyon Samson dashed, his sure-footed
beast passing safely where a more careful animal
would have stumbled.</p>
<p>All this had happened soon after the dispersing of
the ranchmen to search for Jessica, and Samson
had now taken that turn of the trail which led to
the miner&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t likely she&rsquo;s there, though. She&rsquo;d never
travel afoot that long distance, and Buster&rsquo;s in the
stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Winklers received him with gloom. The
hilarious gayety that had once distinguished their
small household had vanished with the loss of Elsa&rsquo;s
money. Their son, and idol, had been defrauded of
a rich future for which they had toiled, and life now
seemed to them but an irksome round of humdrum
duties, to be gotten through with as easily as possible.
Over the cabin hung an air of neglect which
even Samson was swift to note, and most significant
of all, Elsa&rsquo;s knitting had fallen to the floor and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
become the plaything of a kitten, which evoked no
reprimand, tangle the yarn as she would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, neighbors! Ain&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; over and above
cheerful, are you? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, herder. How&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glum, I should say. Where&rsquo;s Lady Jess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolfgang elevated his eyebrows, shrugged his
shoulders and made a gesture of ignorance, but
said no word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost your tongues, mostly, hey? I say&ndash;&ndash;where&rsquo;s
the captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsa lumbered forward to the doorway, and dully
regarded the visitor; then, after a time, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brevity was another contrast to her former
volubility, but it was sufficient to thrill the questioner&rsquo;s
heart with fresh dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she been here to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsa shook her head. Otto came out from the
shed and glanced disconsolately at Samson, then
slowly returned whence he had come.</p>
<p>The herder&rsquo;s temper flamed, and, snapping his
whip at the air, he cried out, hotly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me, you passel of idiots! You think
you know what trouble is just because you&rsquo;ve lost
a handful of money? Well, you don&rsquo;t! You haven&rsquo;t
even guessed at it. Money! The world&rsquo;s full
of that, but there never was more than one Lady
Jess, and I tell you&ndash;&ndash;I tell you&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had spoken out at last the fear he had scarcely
acknowledged, and the shock of his own plain speech
held him silent thereafter. His head drooped, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
great body settled in the saddle, as if the whole
burden of his sixty years had fallen upon him in
that moment. His attitude, even more than his
words, conveyed his meaning to his hearers, and, in
a flash, the real values of what they had loved, and
now lost, fell into their rightful places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money? The little lady?&rdquo; Ah! what, after all,
was the one compared to the other?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man&ndash;&ndash;you lie!&rdquo; retorted Wolfgang, clinching
his fist and advancing with a threatening air. Elsa
stepped to his side, her wide face turning even paler
than it had been, and a startled look dawning in
her eyes. Even Otto, the six-foot &ldquo;child,&rdquo; reappeared
from his retreat and regarded the horseman
reproachfully.</p>
<p>As for him, he roused from his momentary despondency
and glared upon the trio of spectators as if
they, and they alone, were to blame for the calamity
which had befallen.</p>
<p>Question and answer followed swiftly, and again
Samson was off down the slope, headed now for
distant Marion, the least likely of all places wherein
his darling might be found. Once he was out of
sight, the Winkler household resolved itself into an
additional search party; and it was noticeable that,
whereas formerly, when they were leaving the
home, they would carefully secure the cabin against
intruders, they now disdained any further preparation
than kicking the kitten out of doors, and removing
the kettle of boiling stew from the fireplace
to the ground before the door. A fleeting
smile did cross Elsa&rsquo;s face, as she reflected that
the meddler with her knitting would probably
scald itself in the pot, but she didn&rsquo;t care. Her
whole mind was now set upon Sobrante and its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
mistress, and so eager was she to reach the spot
that she set off on her long walk with an alacrity
she had not shown since the discovery of the robbery.</p>
<p>Wolfgang and Otto armed himself each with
a sharp, iron-pointed staff, and silently, with one
accord, started toward El Desierto. Why, even
they could not have explained, beyond the fact that
it seemed a place for hiding things. It was a long
walk, and so weary had the &ldquo;little boy&rdquo; become by
the time the deserted ranch was reached that Wolfgang
left it unfatherly to force a return trip on
that same day, although no signs of recent occupancy
had rewarded their search.</p>
<p>So it was in every case. Jessica had simply and
completely disappeared, and there settled upon the
home the darkest night it had ever known. Even
that on which its master had been brought back
dead did not equal in intensity of anguish the uncertainty
which drove the waiting mother frantic. At
times she would call for a horse and ride wildly
to and fro, peering into every shadowed spot and
call pitifully upon her child, at others she would
hasten to the house, eagerly demanding of Aunt
Sally, &ldquo;has she come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, honey. Not quite yet. Just wait a
spell, and you&rsquo;ll see her all right. Best be here at
home when she does come, Gabriella. You&rsquo;d hate to
have anybody else the first to meet her, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This advice, uttered in tones so gentle they were
hardly recognizable as Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s, would be
followed for the moment, till the torture of dreadful
possibilities would send the distracted ranch
mistress again afield.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>So the night wore away, and sunrise came, and
still there was no returning party that brought good
cheer. Each tarried, for a brief time, to attend to
the live stock under his immediate care, and some
even to snatch a morsel of food, but mostly they
were off and away again, a flask of water and a bit
of hardtack in pocket, oftener than not forgetting
even this meager nourishment.</p>
<p>By the end of the second day the sorrowful news
had spread all over the countryside, and other
ranches were well-nigh as deserted as Sobrante,
while their forces joined in the apparently hopeless
search.</p>
<p>By then, also, Mrs. Trent had resigned herself to
a quiet acceptance of the worst, and sat for hours
at a time rigidly motionless, with only her sense of
hearing intensely alert, strained to its utmost for
whatever news might come. As each party came
back to consult the others, and for the refreshment
that human nature could no longer do without, it
reported to the waiting woman, who received the
message in silence, yet with the courteous bow
which acknowledged the other&rsquo;s effort on her behalf.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally now rose to the occasion as only her
great heart could suggest. All the petty fussiness
which had annoyed her neighbors dropped away
from her as she moved softly, keen-eyed and solicitous,
among them all. The steaming bowl of
coffee and strengthening sandwich, ready on the
instant for each arrival the unshaken hopefulness of
her eyes, and her wordless control of the awestruck
little boys, were comforts scarcely realized in that
dark time; yet comforts truly. Even Gabriella
could not refuse the nourishment so lovingly pressed
upon her, and mechanically drank the cup of broth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
which her friend had taken care should be of the
strongest. To one and all this homely ministering
angel affirmed, with unshaken persistence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jessica Trent is safe. Jessica Trent is coming
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, old Pedro, for the first time in nearly
a twelvemonth, had turned his back upon the mesa
which he loved and set out on a toilsome path. In
his hand he carried a curious, notched stick, upon
which he sometimes leaned, but oftener bore upon
his shoulder, as it were a precious possession that
he must guard. Old as he was, his staff was older
still. It had come to him when the valley mission
had been abandoned, and the padre who bestowed
it upon this, his faithful servant, had also given into
his keeping a valuable secret. This metal-pointed
rod was one thing Pedro never left behind him when
he journeyed from home.</p>
<p>Starting from the east side of the mesa, he dipped
into the canyon; not by the trail over which Jessica
had ridden the ostrich on the day of her eventful
meeting with Morris Hale, but by the farther, ragged
wall where it seemed as if feet so old could
never make their way. Yet make it they did, as
surely if not as swiftly as in their younger days.
There was not the slightest hesitation in their direction,
though there were indeed, frequent pauses
during which the Indian&rsquo;s keen hearing was strained
for an expected sound. After each such halt Pedro
would resume his path, climbing over rocks which
looked insurmountable and skirting others by ledges
less than a span&rsquo;s width. Over this part of the
canyon wall none of the Sobrante ranchmen had
ever come; though below it, along a smoother portion,
ran the flume that watered the ranch in the
valley.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>Darkness found the shepherd still among the overhanging
crags, and with true Indian stolidity he
rested for the night. His blanket wrapped around
him, his staff on the safe inner side, he lay down
upon a shelf of stone and slept as peacefully as in
his cabin on the level mesa, from which two motives
had driven him abroad.</p>
<p>Something had warned him that this approaching
Christmastide might be his last, and that the time
of which he had often dreamed was to come. He
would now test the truth of the secret he had received,
and, if it proved what had been promised, would
share it with his beloved mistress, his priceless
Navidad gift to her and hers.</p>
<p>Also sitting solitary at his basket, weaving on the
isolated island, Pedro had still observed much. Each
trifle was an event to him, and of late these trifles
had gathered thick about him. With annoying
frequency Ferd, the dwarf, had invaded and contaminated
his solitude. The hints which the misshapen
creature had dropped, though receiving no outward
attention, had, nevertheless, remained in the Indian&rsquo;s
mind to disturb it. It was to hunt for this wretched
fellow, as well as to prove his &ldquo;secret,&rdquo; that he was
now in the canyon, believing that when he was
found, there would be Jessica also.</p>
<p>When morning came he rose and tightened his
belt about him and set out afresh. The long sleep
had restored his vigor and his eye gleamed with
satisfaction. The muscles that had stiffened from
long disuse&ndash;&ndash;he would not have admitted that the
stiffness came from age&ndash;&ndash;were limber as of old, and
he felt that, after all, it was good to be once more
upon the trail. But even his confidence would have
been rudely shaken could he have foreseen the
peril wherein that trail would end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>DELIVERANCE</h3>
</div>
<p>A second night of fruitless search upon the rocky
wall passed before the old Indian came to the spot
which he had thought so near, full twenty-four
hours before. He had fed his hunger upon the few
wild plums he had found, and more than once he
had descended to the flume to slake his thirst; then
reclimbed the height again, for there he knew lay
the road of his goal. Again and again he tapped the
solid rock or the scant earth about it for a response
to that magical tip upon his rod; and now, as the
second day lightened the gulch, the response came.</p>
<p>The staff forsook his hand, as it had been a creature
of volition, and stood upright upon a smooth-faced
bowlder. It needed all the man&rsquo;s strength to
wrest it thence, and, grasping it securely, he carefully
descended, for the last time, the precipitous
wall. Always the staff tugged at his grasp, seeking
the earth, but he carried it still toward a clump
of gnarled trees which appeared to him like the
faces of long-lost friends. It seemed to him that in
all the half century since he looked upon them,
neither branch nor twig had altered. So had they
been on that sad day when the last of the padres
had brought him hither and shown them to him.
Beneath their roots lay the secret he had kept so
well.</p>
<p>But the cave&ndash;&ndash;what had become of that? And
the stout shaft of hewn timber which led below
into the heart of earth?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! I deceive myself. I have forgotten, for I
am old; not young as I seemed to me. I have come
in vain,&rdquo; he complained, in his thought; and with a
gesture of despair, in his hunger and weariness,
the shepherd sank upon the ground and dropped
his face on his breast.</p>
<p>Long he sat thus, till there came to him upon
the silence the answer no call could have awaked.
He began to hear sounds. The creeping of some
heavy body amid the chaparral, coming nearer,
more distinct. Some wild shrubs sheltered him
from sight, and, peering through their twigs, he
watched in breathless silence. Ah! Reward!</p>
<p>It was Ferd who approached, as cautiously as if
he were conscious of those gleaming eyes behind
the mesquite, and who, turning in his path, entered
a point among the trees which even Pedro had not
suspected of leading any whither.</p>
<p>It was now the Indian&rsquo;s part to creep after this
crawling creature; and he did so as swiftly, almost
as silently, as if he were the dwarf&rsquo;s mere shadow.
Always he kept a screen of leaves between them,
less needed soon, as the unconscious guide led the
way out of the sunlight into the depths of gloom.
The cave at last!</p>
<p>But the half-wit, Ferd? Had he guessed its
secret?</p>
<p>On and on, it seemed interminably. Now and
then the dwarf would pause and listen, but at every
halt there was utter silence behind him. Then onward
again, and at length into a spacious place,
around the walls of which great jagged rocks made
recesses of impenetrable gloom. With one arm
outstretched, feeling his way, and with his precious
staff secured against his back within his blanket,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
Pedro paused in such a recess just in time, for the
dwarf had struck a match and lighted a lantern.
This he swung round his head, peering in each
direction, and blinded, maybe, by the very rays
with which he sought to disclose any possible follower.
Satisfied that he was alone, Ferd moved
onward again, and Pedro followed, hugging the
chamber wall and screening himself in every
shadow.</p>
<p>But Ferd had no longer any fear of discovery or
any thought of aught save that which lay before
him. The passage was higher now and he could
easily stand upright; the Indian also rising to his
feet, though he had to bow his head lest it should
brush the ceiling.</p>
<p>The dwarf began to talk aloud, to himself, apparently;
but after a moment of this muttering,
grew silent again. He had come to the mouth of a
black pit which seemed to descend into great depths.
In reality the depth was not so great; yet to anyone
within it escape was impossible without help
from above. Into this hole Ferd peered, holding
the lantern so that its rays fell straight downward,
and calling in a jeering voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the &lsquo;captain&rsquo; ready yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ferd! good Ferd! Please, please let me
out!&rdquo; answered a voice that thrilled old Pedro&rsquo;s
heart with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. The money first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have no money. You must help me up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down there safe. Is you hungry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ferd. The food you took out of Aunt
Sally&rsquo;s pantry kept me from that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>The dwarf threw himself backward, on the rocky
floor above, and laughed loudly, yet his mirth was
shortlived. Pedro&rsquo;s hand was on his throat before
a movement had been heard, and Pedro&rsquo;s voice
was calling into the pit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here am I, Sunny Face. Wait. I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During all the hours of her imprisonment, Jessica&rsquo;s
courage had not faltered, but, at the sound of that
blessed cry, it suddenly gave way and she burst
into a paroxysm of sobs and tears, which effectually
prevented her hearing the struggle that ensued
in the gloom between the shepherd and the
hunchback. For though the lantern had not been
extinguished, as it rolled from its owner&rsquo;s hand,
it had fallen upon its one glass side and gave no
light.</p>
<p>For a time, even the Indian feared the issue of
that battle in the dark and the abnormal strength
of the dwarf&rsquo;s long arms; but the craft, if not the
whole vigor of his own youth remained with him,
and at a chance opportunity, he whipped off his
blanket and smothered his opponent&rsquo;s face therein.</p>
<p>The blanket was almost priceless, and, next to
his staff, his dearest possession; but when its heavy
folds had subdued the other to unconsciousness, he
did not hesitate to tear it into strips. With these
Ferd was promptly bound, hand and foot. Then
Pedro recovered the lantern and again called to
Lady Jess:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find a way. Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pedro! I know your blessed voice! There&rsquo;s
a rope somewhere. Ask him. Quick&ndash;&ndash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the dwarf had almost immediately recovered
his breath, recognized his opponent, and now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
directed the search. With a few superstitious ranchmen,
he shared the belief that Old Century was
under supernatural protection, and that it was extremely
dangerous to meddle with one so guarded.
Of all who might have traced him to that hidden
spot, here was the last he wished to meet; and
now that he knew himself beaten, he began to
whimper and plead in a cowardly way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me up, Pedro. Ferd&rsquo;ll take little lady out.
Just fun, to make big talk. Ferd never hurt the
&lsquo;captain;&rsquo; no Ferd is a good boy, Pedro. Ferd is
a good boy. Poor Ferd! Pedro, let poor Ferd go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only attention the shepherd vouchsafed the
whiner was to put his own foot under the inert
body and roll it well back from the pit&rsquo;s mouth.
He had found the rope, a long and costly lariat
which he recognized as having once been the property
of Jessica&rsquo;s father, and he secured it about
an upright timber that he tested and saw was still
firm. Then he took the handle of the lantern between
his teeth and slipped swiftly down the shaft.</p>
<p>As he reached the bottom Jessica threw herself
upon his breast with a fresh outburst of joy and
tears. But he dared not tarry below even with
an apparently helpless enemy above, and, giving her
the rope, he tersely bade her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an intuition of his fear, she promptly obeyed
him and stood guard over the lariat lest Ferd should
make a fresh attempt upon it. Yet it seemed an
interminable time that Pedro stayed below; and
when at last he came above, she held him fast, not
willing again to let him go.</p>
<p>But he was in no haste. Allowing her to keep
between himself and the cavern&rsquo;s wall, even intrusting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
to her care the curious staff that now persisted
in dancing along the cavern&rsquo;s floor in an
elfish way which amazed the girl, he made a circuit
of the place. At one spot he paused, and a single
grunt of satisfaction escaped him. Then he seized
a loaf of bread from a shelf-like niche and began to
eat it eagerly. He even pointed to another, lying
in the same place, but Jessica shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. I am not hungry. He gave me plenty
of stuff to eat. Lots of things that have been missing
from the kitchen and puzzled Aunt Sally so.
Oh! Pedro, let us go! Shall I ever see her again?
or my precious mother? How long has it been?
It seems forever. Come, come! Oh! come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; was the imperturbable answer, and the
only one she could win from him. She was alive
and well. He had found her. There was no cause
for haste, nor had he ever hasted in his long life.
The man who wastes his time in hurry loses all.
He had found what he sought. This was the very
pit, the forsaken shaft of which the padre told him.
It led to what no other person dreamed. Was he
to be balked of his purpose, for the child&rsquo;s whim?
No. It was for her, even, that he tarried.</p>
<p>In his groping about the cave the lantern had revealed
some loose fragments of rock which he now
pushed in front of the dwarf&rsquo;s body, thus making
him a more secure prisoner; and, satisfied that all
was now safe, he descended again into the old shaft,
leaving Jessica in darkness.</p>
<p>Her impatience was almost unbearable, and escape
seemed as distant as ever, but there was
nothing left except that &ldquo;waiting&rdquo; Pedro had so
constantly advised.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>It was rewarded, at last, by his call from the pit,
and even his calm voice was now shaken by excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Sunny Face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning over the edge of the hole, she saw him
point toward the rope and understood that he
wished her to descend, but with a shiver of distrust
she declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time the order was peremptory and she
obeyed it, sliding swiftly down, to be caught and
safely deposited on the floor of the shaft. Placing
the lantern in her hand, the Indian began to gather
a strange collection of articles from one corner of
the narrow chamber and to display them to her.
As each was held up, an exclamation of surprise
broke from her, but even she had grown mostly
silent now, and her interest prevented fear. When
a goodly heap had been piled beside her, she found
her voice again, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon everything that&rsquo;s ever been lost from
Sobrante since it began is down here. Elsa&rsquo;s little
leathern bags with their knitted covers; Beppo&rsquo;s
plumes; Marty&rsquo;s watch, that he thought he had lost
in the gulch; Wun Lung&rsquo;s carved image. Oh, Pedro!
how dreadful and yet how splendid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd allowed her rhapsodies to answer
themselves. Though his eyes betrayed his complacency,
he had more serious work on hand, and,
pointing upward, he commanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch the padre&rsquo;s staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Jess now realized that obedience was the
shortest road to freedom, so climbed and descended
the rope again, with the ease gained by her gymnastic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
training under the &ldquo;boys&rsquo;&rdquo; tuition. But she
took into the pit, beside the staff that curious
basket which she had once seen Ferd carrying up
the canyon and over which she had, most fortunately,
just then stumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Pedro! This will do to hold all those
things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian &ldquo;saw,&rdquo; indeed, that this was a bit of
his own handiwork which had been missing from
the mesa, for many moons. He nodded gravely,
but was more eager for the staff than for his lost
property; and, taking the lantern again to the inner
wall of the shaft, he set the rod upon its point.
It remained motionless, exactly upright, where he
placed it; and now, truly, the old man paused to
gaze upon it in wordless delight. He was so rapt
and still that the girl grew frightened and awestruck,
watching his odd behavior, and begged him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what that means, Pedro! The thing is
bewitched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said the Indian, arousing from his contemplation,
and, stooping began to dig amid the
loose stones at his feet, with the only tools at his
command&ndash;&ndash;his own lean fingers. For these he
sometimes substituted a bit of rock, and to Jessica
it seemed as if he would never give over his strange
task. When she had begun to really despair of the
liberation which had seemed so near a while ago,
he ceased his labor and stood upright, holding
something shining toward the lantern&rsquo;s light. To
the girl it appeared as only another worthless stone,
of a pretty, reddish hue, but wholly unworthy the
toil which had been spent to secure it. She was
further surprised, if anything could now surprise
her, to see the Indian place the fragment carefully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
within his shirt front and tighten his belt afresh
below it. Then he lifted the basket she had filled
with the articles they had found and motioned her
upwards again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;re really going, aren&rsquo;t we, Pedro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sunny Face. We go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, he was as eager for departure as heretofore
he had been loath. Releasing the dwarf&rsquo;s feet
from their bandages, he helped his prisoner to them
and gently propelled him forward by a kick of his
own moccasined toe. Thus compelled, Ferd led the
way, the shepherd at his heels, carrying the basket
slung upon the staff over his shoulder, and his free
hand pressed closely against his breast where he
had placed the gleaming stone. Behind him walked
impatient Jessica, with the lantern, and in suchwise
the little procession came swiftly and silently to
the end of the passage and stood once more under
the free air of heaven. Here they had to halt, for
a moment, till their vision became accustomed to
the dazzling light; then with a cry of rapture, the
&ldquo;captain&rdquo; darted from her comrades and sped wildly
down the rocky gorge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>JESSICA&rsquo;S STORY</h3>
</div>
<p>Though it had seemed as a lifetime to impatient
Jessica that she had been kept in the cave, after
Pedro&rsquo;s arrival there, in reality it was less than an
hour; and it was yet early in the day when a cry
she had expected never to hear again, rang through
the room where Gabriella Trent was lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! My mother! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another instant, and they were clasped in close
embrace as if nothing should ever separate them
again. Words were impossible, at first, and not till
she saw that even joy was dangerous for her overwrought
patient did Aunt Sally, the nurse, interpose
and bodily lift the daughter from the parent&rsquo;s arms.
All at once her own calmness and courage forsook
good Mrs. Benton, and now that she saw the lost
girl restored, visibly present in the flesh, anger
possessed her till she longed to shake, rather than
caress, the little captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jessica Trent! These are pretty goings on,
now ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabriella sat up and her child nestled against her,
their hands clasped and their eyes greedily fixed
upon each other&rsquo;s countenance. The unexpected
brusqueness of the question was a relief to their
high tension, and Jessica laughed, almost hysterically,
as she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t seem very &lsquo;pretty&rsquo; to me, Aunt
Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What a sight you be! Where you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the canyon cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know there was one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I&ndash;&ndash;before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for? What made you stay? Didn&rsquo;t you
know you&rsquo;d raised the whole countryside to hunt
for you? Don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s an able-bodied man
left on a single ranch within fifty miles; all off
huntin&rsquo; for you. You&ndash;&ndash;you ought to be spanked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Benton!&rdquo; warned Gabriella, in a tone of
such distress that the reproved one promptly sank
in a capacious heap on the floor and fell to weeping
with the same vigor that she applied to all things.
Jessica, too, began to cry softly, at intervals, with
such shuddering bursts of sobs, that the mother&rsquo;s
tears, also, were soon dimming the eyes to which
they had been denied during all the past anxiety.
However, this simultaneous downpour was infinite
relief to all; and presently the mother rose and
with the strength happiness gave to her slight figure,
carried her child away to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are safe. You are here. I see that you
have suffered no hurt, and bed is the place for
you. When you have slept and rested you must
tell us all. Oh! my darling! Many hearts have
ached for you, and I thought my own was broken.
But, thank God! thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Sally followed them, and, as if she had been
a new-born baby, the two women washed and made
ready for a long sleep the precious child that had
been given back to them from the grave. Then
the mother sat down to watch while Aunt Sally
hurried to ring the ancient mission bell, whose
harsh clanging had been agreed upon among the
searchers as the signal of good news.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>They all came flocking back, singly or in groups,
from wherever the summons, which could be heard
for miles in that clear air, chanced to find them.
Impatience was natural enough, too, on their part,
since to their eager questions Mrs. Benton could
not give answer beyond the simple statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s back, safe and sound. Says she&rsquo;s
been in a cave, though where it is or whether she&rsquo;s
just flighty in her head, land knows. She&rsquo;s sleepin&rsquo;
now, and it won&rsquo;t be healthy for any you lumberin&rsquo;
men to be makin&rsquo; a noise round the house before she
wakes up, of her own accord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor when Pedro and the subdued dwarf came
slowly over the road would they make any further
explanation. Indeed, they were both utterly silent;
the Indian forcing his captive before him into the
deserted office where he intrenched himself, with
his basket and staff, until such time as it should be
his mistress&rsquo; pleasure to receive him.</p>
<p>Thus, with time on her hands and nothing else to
do, Aunt Sally collared Wun Lung and withdrew to
her kitchen, whence, presently, there arose such
various and appetizing odors that the weary ranchmen
scented a feast, and sought repose for themselves
till it was ready. Samson and John, however,
were called upon for aid, and, whereas they were
ordered to &ldquo;dress six of the plumpest fowl in the
hennery,&rdquo; they brought a dozen, and for &ldquo;one likely
shoat,&rdquo; they made ready two. Nor, when they
were upbraided for wastefulness, were they a whit
abashed, but John demanded, with unfilial directness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, what&rsquo;s got your common sense?
Tisn&rsquo;t only our own folks you&rsquo;re cookin&rsquo; for, but
fifty others, more or less. Do you s&rsquo;pose Cassius
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
Trent would skimp victuals on such a day as this?
My advice to you is: Put on all the pork and bacon
you&rsquo;ve got, to bile; and roast the lamb that was
butchered for our mess; and set to bakin&rsquo; biscuit
by the cartload, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Benton, hold your tongue, or I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t, mother! I&rsquo;ve outgrown spankin&rsquo;
though I&rsquo;d be most willin&rsquo; to submit if &rsquo;twould be
any relief to your feelin&rsquo;s, or mine either. I tell you
this here&rsquo;s the greatest day ever shone on Sobrante
Ranch, not barrin&rsquo; even the one when the &lsquo;captain&rsquo;
came home with the title in her hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You misguided boy, don&rsquo;t I know it? Ain&rsquo;t I
clean druv out my wits a-thinkin&rsquo; ever&rsquo;thing over,
and where in the name of natur&rsquo; am I goin&rsquo; to do
it all, with them horrid gasoline stoves no bigger&rsquo;n
an old maid&rsquo;s thimble, and Pasqually gone off
s&rsquo;archin&rsquo; with the rest, and no&rsquo;count the heft of the
time and my sins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to take breath, or bust, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; cried
her disrespectful son, catching the portly matron
about the spot where her waist should have been
and hilariously whirling her about in a waltz which
his own lameness rendered the more grotesque.
&ldquo;And where can you cook &rsquo;em? Why, right square
in them old ovens at the mission. Full now of
saddles and truck, but Samson and me&rsquo;ll clear &rsquo;em
out lively. I&rsquo;ll make you a fire in &rsquo;em, and they&rsquo;ll
see cookin&rsquo; like they haven&rsquo;t since the padres put
out their own last fires. They weren&rsquo;t any fools,
them fellers. They knew a good thing when they
saw it, and if they tackled a job they did it square.
The ovens they built, just out of baked mud and a
few stones, are as tight to-day as they were a hundred
years ago; and, whew! won&rsquo;t old Pedro, that
found her, relish his meat cooked in &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>Nor was Benton to be outdone in suggestion on
the matter of providing. Some of the searchers had
brought back a quantity of game, with which the
country teemed, and which it had delayed them but
little to shoot. This was levied upon without ado,
and in the preparation of the great feast Aunt
Sally&rsquo;s helpers forgot their fatigue, and were as
deftly efficient as women would have been.</p>
<p>Indeed, between sleep and labor, the hours of
Jessica&rsquo;s unbroken rest passed quickly, after all;
and the good news having spread almost as swiftly
as the ill, the grounds were full of people when,
at last, she awoke. But, even yet, Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s
consideration for others refused a prior or full
hearing of the story to which her faithful helpers
had as good a right as she, if not as intense an
interest in it. She made the child eat and drink,
and went with her to her favorite rostrum when
addressing her &ldquo;company&rdquo; of soldierly &ldquo;boys&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the
horse block. Here the girl stood up and told
her simple tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, dear folks, it was just this way: Aunt
Sally and I were on the porch, and we found Elsa&rsquo;s
ring, all crooked. We couldn&rsquo;t guess how it came
there, and I&rsquo;d just been made pretty angry about
the way you felt toward &lsquo;Forty-niner.&rsquo; Oh! it was
dreadful, dreadful of you all, and I never was so
ashamed of my &lsquo;boys,&rsquo; not in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on with the story, captain. Never mind us,&rdquo;
cried somebody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a little way farther I found a piece of Elsa&rsquo;s
knitted bag. That made me think a lot. Then the
tackers came, all paint, and with Mr. Hale&rsquo;s horse,
that had been on the mesa ever since he was here.
That made me think some more, and I told auntie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
if she wouldn&rsquo;t scold the little ones I&rsquo;d try to find
their clothes. I didn&rsquo;t find them, though, Aunt
Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! Go on! What next?&rdquo; demanded an impatient
listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I saw Ferd. Oh, mother! If I tell I&rsquo;m
afraid they&rsquo;ll hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall be protected, daughter, and you must
tell,&rdquo; said the mother, though she now shrank from
the hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him about the horse and the children,
and he said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; he had fixed them. He had driven
Prince down from the mesa, when Pedro didn&rsquo;t
see him, and had &lsquo;showed that old carpenter&rsquo; something
to pay for kicks and hard words. He knew
something I&rsquo;d like to know. So I asked him what,
and he said it was Elsa&rsquo;s money. But if I didn&rsquo;t
go with him without saying anything to anybody
he wouldn&rsquo;t tell me how to find it. I begged to
tell my mother, but he said her least of all. It
wouldn&rsquo;t take long, only a few rods up the canyon;
so, of course, I went. I thought I should be back
long before dinner-time, and that mother would tell
me to do anything which would clear old Ephraim&rsquo;s
name from your cruel suspicions. And, oh, boys!
You were wrong, you were wrong! He never took
a cent that wasn&rsquo;t his own, and Elsa&rsquo;s money is
found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absolute silence followed this announcement,
then Samson&rsquo;s great voice started the wild &ldquo;Hurrahs&rdquo;
which made the wide valley ring. The cheers
were long and lusty, but when they subsided at last,
Mrs. Trent bade her daughter finish the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a little, but a long way up the canyon;
yet I was so eager to right Ephraim&rsquo;s wrong that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
I didn&rsquo;t feel afraid, though I never have liked Ferd.
He can&rsquo;t help being queer, maybe, with his queer
body to keep his half mind in&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hisses that interrupted her were almost as
loud as the cheers had been, and it would have fared
ill with the dwarf had he at that moment been
visible. Fortunately, he was still under the surveillance
of the grim shepherd, in the locked office,
and the majority of those present were ignorant of
his whereabouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit hindering the captain. Her story is what
we want!&rdquo; cried &ldquo;Marty.&rdquo; &ldquo;The dwarf can wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we went on and on, and into a strange, dark
tunnel, that scared me a little, yet made me more
curious than ever to see the end of it all. The tunnel
led to a cave, and in the cave there was a deep
hole; and before I knew what he was doing, Ferd
had slung a lariat about me and dropped me into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again an interruption of groans and howls, that
were promptly suppressed by a wave of the mistress&rsquo;
white hand; then Jessica continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as he had put me there, he told me he
would keep me till my mother paid him great
money to let me up. Yet he wouldn&rsquo;t even go to
her and ask for it. He said I must promise, and
that she would do anything I said. He told about
a boy in &rsquo;Frisco, he&rsquo;d heard the men say, was taken
from his folks and kept till they paid lots for his
release&ndash;&ndash;even thousands of dollars! Antonio had
taught him that money was the best thing to have.
He believed it. He took it whenever he could find
it. That&rsquo;s what made him take Elsa&rsquo;s, and blame
it upon Ephraim. And I wouldn&rsquo;t promise. How
could I? My dear has no money to give wicked
men, and I knew the dear God would take me back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
to her when He saw fit. As He did, indeed. For
it must have been He who put it into Pedro&rsquo;s heart
to seek the cave just when I needed him most. Only
the Lord could see through all that darkness and
lead the shepherd by that crooked way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and, turning to her mother, laid her
sunny head upon the shoulder that was shaken by
such sobs as moved her faithful ranchmen to
thoughts of deep revenge. Eyes that had not wept
for years grew dim, and out of that circle of listening
men rose a low and ominous sound. Some, remembering
their own idle talk of kidnaping and the
like, shuddered at the practical application the
dwarf&rsquo;s dim mind had made of their words; and
various plans for punishment were forming when
the captain clapped her hands for fresh attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, &lsquo;boys.&rsquo;Do you belong to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay! Heart and soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must mind me. You must let Ferd
alone. You must do even more to please me&ndash;&ndash;and
teach him to be good, not bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None answered these clear, commanding sentences,
which, as the strangers present thought,
came so oddly from such childish lips, and they
wondered at the effect produced upon the Sobrante
men. These glanced at one another in doubt, each
questioning the decision of his neighbor; and then
again at the lovely girl who had never before
seemed so wholly angelic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, little one. Let the &lsquo;admiral&rsquo; speak. Has
she forgiven that human coyote?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unexpected question startled Mrs. Trent.
She was a strictly truthful woman, and found her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
answer difficult. She had never liked the wretched
creature who had just brought such misery to her,
and she now loathed him. She had already resolved
that, while she would protect Ferd from personal
injury, she would see to it that he was put where he
could never again injure her or hers. Her momentary
hesitation told. The whole assemblage
waited for her next word amid a silence that could
be felt, when, suddenly, there burst upon that
silence a series of ear-splitting shrieks which effectually
diverted attention from the perplexed ranch
mistress.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>BEHIND LOCKED DOORS</h3>
</div>
<p>The shrieks were uttered by Elsa Winkler, who
frantically rushed to the horse block, demanding:
&ldquo;Where? Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent gave one glance at the rough, unkempt
woman, and sternly remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsa, you forget yourself! Go back indoors,
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unhappy creature shivered at this unfamiliar
tone, yet abated nothing of her outcry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My money! My money! My money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had come to the ranch thinking only of
Jessica&rsquo;s mysterious absence, and meaning to do
something, anything, which might help or comfort
the child&rsquo;s mother; but the long walk, for one so
heavy and unaccustomed to exercise, had made her
physically ill by the time she reached Sobrante.
Which state of things was wholly satisfactory to
Aunt Sally, who, having received the visitor with
dismay, now promptly suggested bed and rest, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor creatur&rsquo;! You&rsquo;re clean beat out! If
you don&rsquo;t take care, you&rsquo;ll have a dreadful fit of
sickness, and I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;d wait on you if
you did. Not with all this trouble on hand. You
go right straight up into one them back chambers,
where the bed is all made up ready, and put yourself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
to bed, and&ndash;&ndash;stay there! Don&rsquo;t you dast get
up again till I say so; else I won&rsquo;t answer for the
consequences. You&rsquo;re as yeller as saffron, and as
red as a beet. Them two colors mixed on a human
countenance means&ndash;&ndash;somethin&rsquo;! To bed, Elsa
Winkler; to bed right away. I&rsquo;ll fetch you up a cup
of tea and a bite of victuals. Don&rsquo;t tarry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;the mistress!&rdquo; Elsa had panted. &ldquo;I come
so long for to speak her good cheer. I must see
the mistress, then I rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mistress isn&rsquo;t seeing anybody just now, except
me and&ndash;&ndash;a few others. You do as I say, or
you&rsquo;ll never knit another wool shawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. I knit no more, forever, is it? Not I.
Why the reason? The more one earns the more
one may lose. Yes, yes, indeed. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the true word,&rdquo; Mrs. Benton had replied;
&ldquo;and so being you&rsquo;ve no yarn to worry you, nor no
mistress to see, off to bed, I say, and don&rsquo;t you
dast to get sick on my hands, I warn you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Elsa had obeyed the command, glad enough to
rest and be idle for a time. Aunt Sally had seen
to it that the visitor was kept duly alarmed concerning
her red-and-yellow condition, nor had she given
the permission to arise when Wolfgang and Otto
arrived from their fruitless visit to El Desierto.
They found the place crowded with returning
searchers, and joyfully hailed the good news of
Jessica&rsquo;s safety. But when there was added to this
the information that their own property had been
found, they demanded to be taken to Elsa, and it
was their visit to her room which had sent her
afield, half-clad, and with thought for nothing but
her lost treasure.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>Even now, husband and son joined their entreaties
to hers, though Samson soon brought them to hear
reason, and to withdraw from public for the present,
asking, indignantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you folks lost all your manners, as well
as your dollars, up there on the foothill? The idee
of a woman screeching her lungs out afore all the
ranchers in Southern Californy! Your money?
Well, what of it? If it&rsquo;s found, it&rsquo;ll be give to you,
and if it isn&rsquo;t you ain&rsquo;t the first feller&rsquo;s been robbed.
Besides, can&rsquo;t you smell? Don&rsquo;t you know that
you&rsquo;re interruptin&rsquo; the prettiest spread ever was
seen at old Sobrante? Like chicken? Like roast
pig? Like hot biscuit and plum sess? Then go
wash your face, and make your folks fix up and
come enjoy yourself. So far as I hear, it&rsquo;s old
Pedro holds the cash, and you might as well try
to move the Sierras as him, if he ain&rsquo;t ready to move.
At this present writin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s set himself guard over
that scalliwag, Ferd, and I ain&rsquo;t envying him his
job, I ain&rsquo;t. Hurry up, there won&rsquo;t be anything but
necks and drumsticks left for you laggards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus admonished and reassured, Wolfgang
hurried his family away to prepare for the feast,
and the interruption they had caused to the proceedings
at the horse block effectually relieved Mrs.
Trent from an immediate answer to an awkward
question, so she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, daughter. I see by Aunt Sally&rsquo;s manner
that she wishes the people would begin to eat.
Every pair of hands, that belongs to us, must help
in serving these kind neighbors who have flocked
to our aid. Some of them have forty good miles
to ride before they sleep, and they must be fed first.
I&rsquo;ll stand by the head table yonder, and name them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
and do you, for whom they left their business, wait
upon them yourself. That will show them your
gratitude, and give them honor due.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was, and to every dish she brought, the little
captain added a graceful word of thanks, which
seasoned the food better than even Aunt Sally&rsquo;s
wondrous skill had done; and many an encomium
did the child hear, in return, of that lost father
who had made himself so well-beloved in all that
countryside.</p>
<p>When all was over and done, when the last
&ldquo;neighbor&rdquo; had ridden homeward, when everybody
had had his fill, and more than his fill of good things,
and the rudely constructed tables had been removed
from the wide lawn, came Aunt Sally, beaming with
happiness, and glanced over the scene, till there
broke from her lips the wondering question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can this be the same spot that was so dark and
lonely yesterday? I&rsquo;ve had my heartstrings so
stretched and tugged at, betwixt joy and sorrow,
that I don&rsquo;t know myself. I&ndash;&ndash;I believe I&rsquo;m tired!
And if I am, it&rsquo;s about the first time in my life.
Well, well! Talking of Christmas&ndash;&ndash;this little supper
we&rsquo;ve just give is about equal to forty Christmases
in one. Seem&rsquo;s if.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, kind, Aunt Sally, how shall I ever thank
you for all you&rsquo;ve done for us?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Trent,
appearing at her friend&rsquo;s side, and impetuously
clasping the portly matron. The embrace was so
unexpected, for the ranch mistress was never a demonstrative
woman, that its recipient was, for the
instant, speechless; the next, she had turned herself
about and demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriella Trent, have you had a bite to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Have you, Mrs. Benton?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a morsel. I&rsquo;m as empty as a bubble. No
more has the captain touched a thing. She&rsquo;s here,
there and everywhere, among her precious &lsquo;boys,&rsquo;
yet not a one of &rsquo;em has the decency to say: &lsquo;Share
my supper, Lady Jess.&rsquo; If they were my &lsquo;boys,&rsquo;
I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t, mother. And I&rsquo;m glad to see
you two women resting a spell. Keep on sitting
there. We&rsquo;re going to wait on you now, and don&rsquo;t
you believe we haven&rsquo;t put by the pick of the pies
for you all! The captain is fetchin&rsquo; the tackers,
and Pasqual&rsquo;s fetchin&rsquo; the food. But what about
old Pedro and the coyote?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, don&rsquo;t call names, &rsquo;specially hard ones.
They always come home to roost. But I&rsquo;m glad you
do some credit to your upraisin&rsquo;, and did remember
that somebody else, except yourself, might be hungry.
Wait, Gabriell&rsquo;. Don&rsquo;t you worry about that
Indian. I&rsquo;ll just step in and fix him somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not, mother. He&rsquo;s got all the
company he wants at this present writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was sufficient to spur Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s energy
afresh. Curiosity was her besetting sin, and she
could not endure that anything should go on about
the ranch in which she had no hand. Rising rather
hastily from a chair that was much too frail for
her weight, she and it came to grief, and the fact
diverted her attention for the time.</p>
<p>John was glad of this, though outwardly he sympathized
with her slight mishap, and facetiously
offered her a dose of her own picra.</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent also rose, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to Pedro. Though I did try to thank
him, when he first came, I had but a moment to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
give him then, and I fear he will feel he has been
neglected. As if I could ever neglect one to whom
I owe my darling&rsquo;s restoration!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Benton looked after her, and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she goes again! and that woman hasn&rsquo;t
tasted a mouthful in a dog&rsquo;s age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long&rsquo;s a &lsquo;dog&rsquo;s age,&rsquo; Aunt Sally?&rdquo; demanded
Ned as he helped himself to a buttered biscuit which
Pasqual had just placed on the old lady&rsquo;s plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Age as long as a dog,&rdquo; commented Luis, seizing
the biscuit from his mate and running away with
it. Of course, Ned gave chase, and the usual battle
ensued, after which they dropped down upon the
spot where they had fought, threw their arms
around each other&rsquo;s necks, and munched the biscuit
together with an air of cherubic delight.</p>
<p>Everybody laughed at the pair, upon which Aunt
Sally now descended with a threatening mien and a
plate of plum cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourselves, you naughty
children? Fighting half your time. Here! Eat
that and let your suppers stop. By the way, how
many suppers have you had already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six or seven,&rdquo; promptly replied Ned, who had
eaten with whoever invited him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty-seven,&rdquo; echoed Luis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then to bed you go, this instant!&rdquo; And off
they were marched, without delay. Of course, this
was another postponement of Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s own
meal, but she didn&rsquo;t mind that, so long as she had
an opportunity to deal with the small lads. Explaining
to them, as she undressed and bathed them:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d go to wrack and ruin if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t for me takin&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
a hand in your upbringin&rsquo; now and then. You pull
the wool over Gabriella&rsquo;s eyes the worst ever was.
My! What you doing now, Edward Trent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pullin&rsquo; wool, like you said!&rdquo; and wound the
white blanket he had caught from his cot the more
tightly about Luis&rsquo; head.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ranch mistress had gained the
office and asked admission at its locked door. When
a long wait ensued, she reflected rather anxiously
upon what the men had often said, &ldquo;That Old Century
is as top-lofty as a king. Thinks he is a king,
in his own rights, and his having lived a hundred
years makes him better&rsquo;n anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was quite true. Faithful and devoted to her
as he was, the shepherd exacted even from her the
respect that was his due. On that day he felt that
much more than ordinary consideration was owing
him; yet he had been left for hours, unvisited by
her for whom he had done, and meant still to do,
so much. Therefore, it was with a bearing full of
injured dignity that he at last slid the bolt and
opened the door, though he did not invite the visitor
to enter, nor withdraw from the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to see about your supper, good Pedro.
Do you know that it has been cooked in the old
mission oven? That should make it taste fine to you.
You must pardon my not being earlier, but there
have been so many, many guests. All gone now,
save our own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senorita, am I not also a guest, yes? Was one
at Sobrante as old as me? Should not I have ruled
the feast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you should, my friend, if there had been
any ruling whatever. It was simply take and eat,
and away to their distant homes. You are already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
at home, nor have I, either, tasted food. Come now
and feast with me. I am hungry, and so should
you be. You mustn&rsquo;t keep the mistress waiting, you
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pedro&rsquo;s countenance had softened, and he had
expended all his sternness, but his caution remained.
With a significant glance toward his prisoner, the
dwarf, he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he is safe, then will I break my fast. The
senorita does me honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I should like to do, dear Pedro.
But is not poor Ferd safe in here? Can we not
send him in some supper and turn the lock upon
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not hide the repugnance she felt toward
the miserable, misshapen creature, now sleeping on
the floor, and after one glance in his direction looked
swiftly away. But that glance had been sufficient
to startle her by its resemblance to another face
she hoped never to see again.</p>
<p>Pedro&rsquo;s keen old eyes noticed her surprise and
dismay, and he smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mistress sees. Slumber shows it&ndash;&ndash;the likeness.
One breed of snakes were in the den. Fear
both, watch both, for they are brothers. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, then, explained many things; not the least,
the wonderful influence and control which Antonio
had always maintained over his half-witted &ldquo;left
hand,&rdquo; as the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; called the unfortunate hunchback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antonio&ndash;&ndash;Ferdinand&ndash;&ndash;both Bernals&ndash;&ndash;brothers?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Trent, in a tremulous voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Si. Yes, indeed. In truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And all this time nobody knew or suspected it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senorita, the master knew. That was part of
his great goodness to the wicked one who would
ruin him if he could. &rsquo;Ware Antonio&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;ware Ferd.
One is the shadow of the other. One thinks, the
other works. When Antonio went, Ferd stayed.
No good, senorita. Watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady sat down upon the nearest chair, and,
as she did so, caught sight of the basket upon the
desk. It was filled to overflowing with articles of
various sorts, and beside it lay the curious metal-pointed
staff. Her impulse was to reach forward
and take it, but the Indian arrested her hand by an
upward motion of his own. Then he opened it himself
and showed her, at the bottom, a number of
leathern bags with knitted covers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsa&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pedro silently assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us call her, and give it back to her at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fools must learn. Let the miner come, and
Samson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent stepped outside and dispatched a messenger
for the two men, who presently came; the
one glum and offended, thinking in his slow way
that he had been made a jest of, and that the money
his wife so loved had not, after all, been found.
The other, as always, proud and alert to serve the
&ldquo;admiral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had entered the room, Wolfgang&rsquo;s eyes
at once rested greedily upon the basket, which
Pedro had again closed, as if he guessed what treasure
lay within. Samson&rsquo;s glance went straight to
the sleeping dwarf, and an almost irresistible impulse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
to kick the inert figure possessed him. But he
restrained himself, and colored high when he met
the lady&rsquo;s own glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Samson, please. No violence. Yet it is
Pedro&rsquo;s wise advice that Ferd be placed under the
charge of somebody who shall know at all times
just where he is and what he is about. Will you
take that charge, herder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t the kind of cattle I keep, &lsquo;admiral.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand it isn&rsquo;t a pleasant task. That&rsquo;s not
the question, which is simply: Will you be responsible
for&ndash;&ndash;Ferdinand Bernal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mighty sailor fairly jumped, but his reply
was: &ldquo;You could knock me down with a feather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent laughed. &ldquo;Yes, it is strange. But
look sharp. The resemblance is strong. Pedro
knows the relationship, and my husband knew it.
I did not, until just now. Something better may
suggest itself to you or me, but for the present,
will you take charge of this unhappy one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A delayed and most reluctant &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; came at last
from the herder&rsquo;s lips. If he had been asked to
punish the dwarf the answer would have been swift
and eager; but &ldquo;take charge!&rdquo; That meant constant
association, decent treatment and responsibility
for the most &ldquo;slippery&rdquo; of human beings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, please take him away at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferd had roused, and was sitting up; so that when
Samson laid his great hand on the lad&rsquo;s shoulder,
the latter understood, in a dim way, that he was
now the herder&rsquo;s, rather than the shepherd&rsquo;s prisoner.
Of the two, he would have preferred the
latter keeper; but he would bother with neither
very long.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>It was a relief when the door closed upon the
outgoing pair, and Pedro rose and locked it. There
was something preternaturally solemn and mysterious
in his manner as, placing a chair nearer to the
desk for Mrs. Trent, he motioned Wolfgang to
take another opposite. Then, standing between
them he drew the basket toward himself, and keeping
one hand upon it, thrust the other within his
shirt and drew from that the reddish bit of rock
which Jessica had seen him so careful of.</p>
<p>Holding it so that the last rays of the sun fell
through the window full upon it, he extended it
on his open palm and demanded of the miner:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>A ROYAL GIFT</h3>
</div>
<p>Wolfgang took the bit of stone in his own fingers
and examined it critically. Always deliberate
in his words and actions, he was now doubly so,
and Mrs. Trent grew impatient of a situation which
seemed unimportant, and that delayed for others,
as well as herself, a much needed supper.</p>
<p>But Pedro was not impatient. He stood with
folded arms and triumphant bearing, ready for the
miner&rsquo;s reply, whether it came soon or late; also,
quite ready to disregard it should it be different
from that expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Wolfgang?&rdquo; asked the ranch mistress.</p>
<p>The miner heaved a prodigious sigh, and returned
the ambiguous answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I have thought already, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you thought, good Wolfgang?&rdquo; demanded
the lady, looking toward the Indian&rsquo;s glowing
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copper. Copper, without alloy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; grunted Pedro, with satisfaction, and
taking the metal again in his hand bowed low and
gravely presented it to his mistress.</p>
<p>She received it without enthusiasm, wondering
what significance could attach to a bit of stone
that might have been picked up anywhere. Her
husband had believed that everything valuable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
would, sooner or later, be unearthed from the
mountains of the State he so loyally loved, but her
own interest in the subject was slight. However,
she must say something grateful or again offend
the dignity of her venerable servitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Pedro. It is very pretty. I will add
it to the case of minerals that your master arranged
yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shepherd cast one contemptuous glance toward
the shelves she indicated, and straightened
himself indignantly. He had loved and revered her,
ever since she came a bride to Sobrante, and had
tended him through a scourge of smallpox, unafraid
and unscathed. Though she was a woman, the sex
of whose intelligence he had small opinion, he had
regarded her as an exception, and his disappointment
was great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it but a &lsquo;thank you,&rsquo; si? Does not the senorita
know what this gift means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess that I do not, Pedro. Please explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were the old padres wise, mistress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have always understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen. From them it came; from the last who
left the mission here for another&ndash;&ndash;to me, his son
and friend. Into the heart of the world we went,
and he showed me. Down low, so low none dream
of it, lies that will make you rich. Will there be
anybody anywhere so rich as the senorita and her
little ones? No. But no, not one. This I give you.
It is for the Navidad, the last old Pedro will ever
see. And the senorita answers, &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was deeply hurt, and his manner was now
full of an eloquent scorn. He was returning the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
stone to his breast, when she asked for it again,
saying, gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so old and wise, good Pedro, you must
bear with my ignorance and teach me. This is
copper, you say. It is very pretty, but how can it
make me rich? I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolfgang answered for the other, and his phlegmatic
face had lost its ordinary expression for one
of keen delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, what the old man tells you, mistress.
He means&ndash;&ndash;he must mean&ndash;&ndash;somewhere on your
property lies a vein of this metal. The dead master
thought the coal was fine already. Ay, so, so. But
copper! Mistress Trent, when this vein is mined,
what Pedro says&ndash;&ndash;yes, yes. In all this big country is
not one so rich as he who owns a copper mine. Ach,
himmel! It is a queen he has made you, and you say,
&lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had fully caught the shepherd&rsquo;s enthusiasm
and feeling, and for the first time in his life looked
upon the lady of Sobrante as a dull-witted person.</p>
<p>But she was no longer dull. Even if it seemed an
impossibility that even this &ldquo;vein&rdquo; could be mined,
since she had no money to waste in an experiment
so costly, still she realized, at last, what Pedro&rsquo;s
will had been. Catching his hand between her own
soft palms, she pressed it gratefully, and beamed
upon him till he smiled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever comes of it. Pedro, you have given
us a royal aguinaldo<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[B]</a>, and I do appreciate it. Come
now, and share our rejoicing over that greater good
that you have brought to Sobrante&ndash;&ndash;the salvation
of its little captain. For that&ndash;&ndash;for that&ndash;&ndash;I have not
even the &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;; my feeling is too deep.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>Though he showed it little, the old man was
almost as moved as she, and he followed her as
proudly as if he were the &ldquo;king&rdquo; his fellow ranchmen
called him. Yet even pride did not prevent his
being cautious still, and he carried the basket and
staff away with him, though Wolfgang protested,
and asked, angrily now:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money? Is it not my Elsa&rsquo;s, yes? Would
you break her heart already, and the little one so
needing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent laughed. She, too, wondered that the
Indian had not at once surrendered the other&rsquo;s
property, but understood that he could not be
hurried. So she merely suggested that Wolfgang
bring his family around to the living room immediately
after sunset, when, doubtless, he would receive
his own again.</p>
<p>At that time, also, she meant to have John Benton
present, to hear what Pedro had to say about
this copper find, and to comfort him in his disappointment,
for between these two there had always
been close friendship.</p>
<p>However, to her surprise, John attempted no comfort.
He was instantly and heartily on the shepherd&rsquo;s
side, and demanded, excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begging pardon for plain words, as you are a
woman with growing children, can you sit there
calm as molasses and say &lsquo;you wish you could do
something about it,&rsquo; yet say no more. &lsquo;Wish!&rsquo;
Why, land of Goshen! this ain&rsquo;t a wishin&rsquo; sort of
business, this ain&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hurray for old Sobrante!
Hurray, hurray, hurray!&rsquo; Call &rsquo;em in, captain,
dearie! Call in the whole crowd! That was the
luckiest gettin&rsquo; lost anybody ever had! Oh, won&rsquo;t
somebody call &rsquo;em in?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>To the group about the table it seemed that the
sensible carpenter had suddenly gone mad. Nobody
had ever heard him so address the mistress whom
he loved, and his excited prancing around the room,
alternately hugging and examining the mineral in
his hand, added to the impression. While the captain
departed to summon the other &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; Aunt
Sally attempted to reduce her hilarious son to
sanity by a sharp box on the ear, and the sharper
reprimand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, John Benton! Do you mean to bring my
gray hairs with sorrer to the grave? What&rsquo;s the
reason of these goings on, I&rsquo;d like to know? I
never was so disgraced in all my life, never. Now,
quit! Quit to once, or&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paid no heed to her, but laid his hand on
Pedro&rsquo;s shoulder and shook it vigorously, demanding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a feller are you, anyway? Why in
the name of sense didn&rsquo;t you tell this thing while
the boss was alive? Shucks! Half of you is Indian,
and that means dirt. Known it all this time, and
kept it hid! You&rsquo;d ought to be drawn and quartered,
that&rsquo;s what you had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Benton advanced with threatening hand,
and from force of habit he retreated before her, and
sank into the nearest chair; so that, when his mates
entered, they found him sitting with bent head and
down-hanging hands, as limp and inert as if his
vitality had been sapped by the news he had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked &ldquo;Marty,&rdquo; making his respectful
salutation to the mistress, but looking past her
toward the carpenter, who, with another change
of mood, sprang again to his feet and waved the
fragment of mineral overhead, exclaiming:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This is &lsquo;up&rsquo;! Copper&rsquo;s &lsquo;up&rsquo;! Sobrante&rsquo;s &lsquo;up&rsquo;!
And lucky the men that belong to it. Only&ndash;&ndash;that
old villain, yonder, has known it even since forever,
and was mean enough to keep his secret. That&rsquo;s
what he is, that Pedro, yonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, with another whimsical change, he seized
the shepherd&rsquo;s hand and wrung it till even that
hardened member ached. But the Indian remained
as calm and undisturbed, amid the torrent of blame
or praise, as if he had been sitting alone at his weaving
on the mesa. His soul was satisfied at last.
He had done that which he had pondered doing
for many years, without being able, heretofore, to
bring his thought to action. Surely he had known
that, locked within his own breast, his &ldquo;secret&rdquo; was
worthless; yet he had clung to it tenaciously. Now
he had imparted it to others, and behold! all the
world knew it, even so soon. Well, that did not
matter. It was no longer his. His part was ended.
Meanwhile, on his beloved upland, there was a faithful
collie watching for his return, and lambs bleating,
needing his care. Suddenly he rose, placed his
cherished staff in Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s hands, and bowing
low, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep this, as I have kept it, where none but you
may find. At the Navidad I come once more, the
last. Adios.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His departure was so unexpected that, at first,
they did not try to prevent it, but Jessica was swift
to follow and protest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night, dear Pedro! Please not to-night.
You have been so good to me, you must stay and
be glad with us this one night. In the morning&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning the sheep will need new pasture.
Adios, nina.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if go you must, it shall not be on foot.
Wait! I know! Prince, Mr. Hale&rsquo;s horse, that
he left with you on the mesa. It is here. The
naughty children painted him, but I saw him in the
corral, just now, and you shall ride him home. That
is if you will not stay, even for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Navidad. Till then, adios.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had never heard him talk so much nor so well
as since these few hours among his friends. He
seemed to be almost another Pedro than the silent
shepherd of the mesa, and as she followed him,
taking his direct way to the paddock, she wondered
at the uprightness of his bearing and the unconscious
dignity which clothed him like a garment.
Then she remembered something else&ndash;&ndash;his blanket,
and sprang to his side again, entreating:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one five minutes more, Pedro. Your blanket.
You must have a new one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated and sighed. Then shook his head
sadly. That which he had torn, to bind the dwarf,
had been a Navajo weave, so fine and faultless that
even he, the wonderful weaver, knew it for a marvel.
There could not be its mate in all that country,
nor had been since the old padres went and took with
them, as he believed, all the wisdom of the world.</p>
<p>Before he had caught and bridled the horse,
Jessica was back, and playfully enveloped in a
wonderful piece of cloth that made the Indian stare.
If it were not the mate to his lost treasure, it was
quite as fine and soft, as generous in size, and far
cleaner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, dear old fellow. This was my father&rsquo;s. My
mother sends it to you with her love. Put it on,
so I may see how fine you look. Oh, grand! When
the children play &lsquo;Indian&rsquo; why can&rsquo;t they copy you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
and not those dirty Diggers, that Ferd teaches them
to be like! Pedro, you are splendid, and&ndash;&ndash;I love
you! I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once, as she gazed upon him, there returned
to her a memory of that dark time in the cavern&rsquo;s
pit, where he had found her, and which, in the general
rejoicing over her safety she had, for the present,
almost forgotten. By now, save for this old
man, she might have been dead.</p>
<p>He received the onslaught of her embrace exactly
as he had accepted the gift of the blanket&ndash;&ndash;in
silence. There was a momentary lighting of his
somber eyes, but no word, as, putting her quietly
down upon the ground, he mounted the barebacked
Prince and loped swiftly away into the darkness
and solitude.</p>
<p>Brighter by contrast was the room to which the
little captain returned, after Prince and his rider
had vanished into the night, and the circle of lamp-lighted
faces gleamed with excitement. Everybody
seemed trying to outtalk his neighbor, and only one
glowering countenance showed dark by contrast;
the face of Elsa Winkler, with its eyes angrily fixed
upon the basket which Mrs. Trent held on her lap,
quite forgetting what it contained in her listening
to the others&rsquo; words.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Samson brought his fist down upon the
table, enforcing a brief silence, while demanding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s amiss with using the capital on hand?
There sits our &lsquo;admiral,&rsquo; with money enough in that
basket to start the whole business. Set Wolfgang
to manage, and the rest of us to dig and delve.
More&rsquo;n one here has tried mining for a yellower
metal than this&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;holding up the bit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
copper&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;&rsquo;twould do us proud to give the first pick to Sobrante&rsquo;s
fortune! Lads, what say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and right off! That&rsquo;s what we say!&rdquo; cried
somebody, but Mrs. Trent lifted her hand, and they
were silent.</p>
<p>She had become as interested now as any of the
others; far more, indeed, since if this amazing tale
of Pedro&rsquo;s proved true she would be able, at last,
to fulfill her husband&rsquo;s interrupted life-work, and
make Sobrante a power for good in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Elsa say? Will she lend us this
money?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE FACE AT THE WINDOW</h3>
</div>
<p>All waited breathlessly for Elsa&rsquo;s answer. They
knew her greed, or, rather, why she hoarded her
money so closely, and were not so surprised, after
all, when it came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t? I should like to know why you can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
demanded John Benton, indignantly, though Mrs.
Trent protested against his urgency by a nod of her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for the little one. It is mine. I want it
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranch mistress at once extended the basket,
but it was now the carpenter&rsquo;s turn to object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, &lsquo;admiral,&rsquo; not so fast. Let her tell us,
first, how much money she lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsa caught her breath. To save her life she
could not have stated in exact figures the sum, because,
though she had known to a dime before the
robbery, at, and after that time, she had recklessly
tossed aside the little that remained. This wasted
portion belonged with the whole amount, and being
as truthful as she was penurious, she hesitated.
Her color came and went, as she looked anxiously
into John&rsquo;s face, realizing that he had laid a trap
for her and caught her in it.</p>
<p>But the mistress confronted her, saying:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that, Elsa. I do not blame you for
refusing to try experiments with what you have
so hardly earned and so nearly lost. These are
certainly your own little money bags, as I judge
from their knitted covers; but it is just possible
there may have been other money added to that
was taken from you. So, tell me as nearly as you
can, what you had, and we will examine them all
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was wise, and commended itself even to the
eager Elsa, who stated promptly and proudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three t&rsquo;ousand of the dollars it was. All gold.
Big gold and littles ones. In them bags was lost
entirely. In the others&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know. Oh! I don&rsquo;t
know. It was much, much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Wolfgang&rsquo;s turn to interpose, and he did
so, sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsa, wife! Three thousand dollars, and I not
know it! How dare you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach! how not dare I? It was the new pick, or
the new pushcart, or the new everything, is it not
so? Well, then, if one would save one need not
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s face saddened, and, seeing this,
Jessica impatiently exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hate money! It&rsquo;s always that which
makes the trouble. It was about money that those
New York folks made such wicked charges against
my father. It was for a little money that you &lsquo;boys&rsquo;
were so quick to ruin &lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo;s&rsquo; character. It
was money, and the greed for it, that changed
Antonio from a good to a bad man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, captain. There wasn&rsquo;t ever any &lsquo;change&rsquo;
in him. He was born that way.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He was born a baby, wasn&rsquo;t he, John? All
babies are good, I s&rsquo;pose. It&rsquo;s loving money has
made Ferd do such dreadful things; and now, over
a little money, Wolfgang and Elsa are quarreling,
though I never heard them speak crossly to each
other before. Oh, I hate it! Give it all back to
her, mother dear, and let us forget all that Pedro
said. I, for my part, hope his old copper mine will
never be dug out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some who heard her laughed, but the mother
grew even graver than at first, and looked searchingly
into her daughter&rsquo;s face. Again there came
to her mind the consciousness that the little girl
was growing up in a strange fashion; seeming both
too wise and too simple for her years. It could
never be any different at Sobrante, where one and
all conspired to spoil her, though innocently enough,
and from pure affection. How could she, single-handed,
combat these hurtful influences?</p>
<p>The answer came swiftly enough in a second
thought: &ldquo;Money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there were but a little more of that power for
good as well as evil in her possession she could send
the child to some fine school and have her educated
properly. The separation would be like death in
life to herself, but what true mother ever thought
of self where her child was concerned? Certainly,
not Gabriella Trent. It was with a little sigh that
she put her arm about Lady Jess and drew her to
her side, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, daughter, you and John examine these
bags together, while the rest of us look on and tally
for you. I want Elsa to have her own, at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved the books and papers from the table,
and Jessica emptied the contents of the bags into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
one gleaming heap near the big lamp, whose light
gave an added radiance to the coins, making more
than one pair of eyes sparkle and stare. None
could remember ever to have seen so large an
amount displayed outside a bank window.</p>
<p>Even John&rsquo;s hands trembled slightly as he began
to count the double eagles first, pushing each five
of these toward his small co-laborer and reckoning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred. Two hundred. Three hundred&ndash;&ndash;one
thousand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thousand!&rdquo; echoed Jessica, in turn handing
the pile to her mother, while the others watched,
counting each for himself in silence, ready to check
any blunder that might be made.</p>
<p>That is, the men were silent, but Elsa and Aunt
Sally rather disturbed the proceedings; the former,
by eagerly reaching out for the piles as each was
arranged before the mistress, and being as regularly
rebuked by the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go again, woman! How can they
count right if you don&rsquo;t have patience? Keep your
hands still, do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Benton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your tongue, mother, too. Two thousand!&rdquo;
rejoined John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two&ndash;&ndash;thousand!&rdquo; cried Jessica, tallying. But
her voice had now lost its impatience, and she began
to have a very different feeling in regard to this
&ldquo;money,&rdquo; which looked so real, and was so much
needed at Sobrante. If Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;copper&rdquo; could be
transmuted into shining golden eagles, why, after
all, she guessed she didn&rsquo;t hate it quite so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three&ndash;&ndash;thousand&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;ain&rsquo;t half&ndash;&ndash;touched
yet!&rdquo; gasped Samson, throwing up his great hands
in a gesture of astonishment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>Elsa was also gasping then, and the expression
of her face was changing into one from which Mrs.
Trent involuntarily turned her eyes. Cunning and
avarice predominated, and in the woman&rsquo;s throat
was a curious clicking sound, as if she had lost and
were trying to find her voice. Which, when
found, seemed not to belong to the good-natured
Elsa, so changed it was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ach, me! But I forgot already. I guess&ndash;&ndash;it was
not three t&rsquo;ousand; it was two times so much. That
was seven t&rsquo;ousand, is it not? The money of this
America&ndash;&ndash;it so confuse, yes,&rdquo; and she tapped her
forehead with one fat finger, while her eyes grew
beady, and seemed to shrink in size as they gazed
upon the wealth she coveted.</p>
<p>But Wolfgang would have none of this. He was
as honest as the sun, and, till that moment, had
supposed his wife to be of one mind with him.
Indeed, honest she had been, in thought and deed,
until that terrible temptation was spread before
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elsa! Elsa Winkler! Is it my wife you was and
would lie&ndash;&ndash;lie&ndash;&ndash;for a bit of that rubbish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Rubbish&rsquo; is good,&rdquo; commented &ldquo;Marty,&rdquo; under
his breath, but nobody smiled.</p>
<p>The woman cowered. Accustomed as she was to
domineer over the seemingly weak-willed man,
there had been times, within her memory, when
he had thrown off her rule and asserted himself to
a degree that terrified her. She had stumbled upon
one of those times now, and sank back in her place
with a deprecating gesture, advancing the flimsy
protest:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Are they not my bags, so? Sewed I them not
with my own hands out of the skin of the little kid
was killed? The covers I knitted with&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miner raised his hand, and she dropped her
eyes before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her what belongs, if you will, good lady,
and let us be gone,&rdquo; he said, pulling his forelock
respectfully to Mrs. Trent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone! Why no, Wolfgang, not to-night. It&rsquo;s
a long way, and you should wait till morning. Indeed,
you should,&rdquo; she replied, at the same time
sending a questioning glance toward John Benton,
and pushing toward Elsa all the empty bags and
three of the thousand dollar piles.</p>
<p>For the carpenter nodded swift acquiescence, on
his part longing to be rid of &ldquo;them miserly Dutchmen,
barring the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsa rapidly recounted, and bestowed the eagles
within their receptacles, and these again, wrapped
in a handkerchief, within her bosom. Then, as
coolly as if she had not made an unpleasant exhibition
of herself, she turned to her hostess and smiled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go now, mistress. I thank you already for one
good time I have. It is to buy the mine, one day,
for my child. I must be going. Yes, I must. The
stew! Ach! how I forgot! The cat&ndash;&ndash;it was a good
stew, no? And the cat has eat the stew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better stew the cat!&rdquo; suggested
Marty, with a facetiousness to which she paid no
heed.</p>
<p>Holding out her hand for Otto to take it, she
commanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little heart, but come. It is in bed you should
be, yes. Good-by, all,&rdquo; adding in German, &ldquo;May
you sleep well!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>Wolfgang followed the retreating pair, but turned
on the threshold to make his obeisance to the ranch
mistress, and to say, &ldquo;At your service, good lady.
My pick and my head.&rdquo; Then, bowing again toward
all the company, he disappeared.</p>
<p>Everybody felt the relief of their departure, and
Aunt Sally humorously threw a kiss after them, remarking,
with a sniff:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed be nothing, if somethin&rsquo; is going to make
a hog out of a decent woman. That there Elsy&rsquo;d
been content with half she got if she hadn&rsquo;t seen
the rest that heap. I&rsquo;m a good deal like Jessie, here.
I think money&rsquo;s the root of all evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t an original observation, mother,
though you do speak as if it was. Money&rsquo;s the
root of a pretty consid&rsquo;able comfort, too; and I&rsquo;d
like to know, for one, where in creation all this
that&rsquo;s left came from,&rdquo; returned John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind, that it came out
of the Trent pocketbook, every dollar of it!&rdquo; said
Samson. &ldquo;But how it came into Ferd&rsquo;s fist is more&rsquo;n
I can guess. Seems if even a half-wit would steal
from his own brother, and it must have passed
through Antonio&rsquo;s hands first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antonio&rsquo;s brother!&rdquo; cried Marty, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the true word. Pedro knew it, and the
master knew it. The &lsquo;admiral&rsquo; heard it, first, to-day;
along with that other secret about the copper. Ain&rsquo;t
any harm in mentioning it, is there?&rdquo; said Samson.</p>
<p>The lady laughed, and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if there were the harm is done, herder.
But that&rsquo;s right. I wish no secrets at Sobrante.
I like to feel that we are all one family in interests
and affection, as my husband wished. And now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
remains this gold. What is to be done with it?
Where shall we bestow it that it may be both safe
and ready when needed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Sally immediately went and closed the door
and locked it; then fastened the windows and pulled
the shades over them. At which a shout arose that
the old lady heeded not a whit. She clasped her
hands over her breast and her round face turned
pale, as she whispered shrilly enough for all to hear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re undone! We&rsquo;re all undone! We&rsquo;re a
passel of fools&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Oh, suz!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down she dropped into a chair, and there was no
more laughter. She was not a timid woman, and
her fright was evident. Her son stepped to her
side and laid his hand on her shaking shoulder, demanding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails you, mother? What did you see?
Why did you lock the doors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit chattering your teeth together. What did
you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, son! I seen a&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;ghost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her courage began to return, and her anger to
rise. She retorted promptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trash! A ghost. A spirit! As sure as I&rsquo;m
a-settin&rsquo; here this minute; the spirit of&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It aggravated John that she should pause and
peep behind her, to be sure the windows were still
covered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit of what tomfoolery has possessed
you, mother, I&rsquo;d like to know? What&rsquo;s the use of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
scarin&rsquo; folks half to death? As if we hadn&rsquo;t had
enough things happen without your cuttin&rsquo; up, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, John Benton, you sassy boy.
As sure as I&rsquo;m alive, I saw the ghost of Antonio
Bernal peeking in at that open window afore I
shut it. He was so white I couldn&rsquo;t tell him from
paper, and so thin I &rsquo;peared to see clean through
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, mother! You&rsquo;re overtired, and for once
in your life really nervous. I reckon it&rsquo;s the sight
of more money than ever come your way before.
Well, forget it. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t yours nor mine. We&rsquo;ve no
cause to worry. I&rsquo;ll step and get you a drink of
water and then you&rsquo;ll feel all right, and would better
go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want water, and I shan&rsquo;t go to bed. I
shan&rsquo;t close my eyes this night, John Benton, and
you needn&rsquo;t touch to tell me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Stay awake if you like. It&rsquo;s nothing
to me,&rdquo; answered the exasperated man, who, in
spite of his strong common sense, had been more
startled than he cared to admit, even to himself.
But, glancing at Mrs. Trent and Jessica, he now
felt that it would be wiser to express his own fear,
which was of nothing supernatural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s upset, &lsquo;admiral,&rsquo; and don&rsquo;t you let her
upset you, too. The fact is, we&rsquo;re a very careless
set at Sobrante, where everything is&ndash;&ndash;or used to
be&ndash;&ndash;all open and above board. It&rsquo;s a new thing for
keys to be turned on this ranch, and it&rsquo;s a new
thing for us to go suspecting one another of sneak
notions. I, for one, am ashamed enough of the
way I&rsquo;ve felt about old Ephraim Marsh, and if he
don&rsquo;t show up pretty soon, I&rsquo;ll make a special trip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
to Los Angeles to tell him so. Even if I have to
foot it the heft of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howsomever, all the world ain&rsquo;t as honest as
them that had the honor of knowin&rsquo; Cassius Trent.
There&rsquo;s been a power of strangers on these premises
durin&rsquo; these last days; and it stands to reason that
among &rsquo;em one villain might have crept in. I ain&rsquo;t
sayin&rsquo; there was. I&rsquo;ll never accuse nobody again&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;cept&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;cept&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the honest fellow interrupted himself with
a laugh; remembering his ingrained suspicion of the
two Bernals, which he would never even try to
overcome. But he went on again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother thinks she&rsquo;s seen somethin&rsquo;, and like
enough she has. There might be some scamp
hangin&rsquo; around; and if there was, and he looked
through that window and saw all this gold, I don&rsquo;t
wonder his face was ghosty-lookin&rsquo;, nor&ndash;&ndash;Somebody
stop me talking and answer this: Where&rsquo;s
the safest place to stow that pile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment nobody replied. Mrs. Trent was
wishing, most heartily, that the money had never
come into her possession, since she did not know to
whom she should restore it; and beginning to feel,
with Jessica, that &ldquo;money&rdquo; did carry discord and
danger with it.</p>
<p>But the little captain was now all eagerness, and
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how I wish I&rsquo;d seen it! Aunt Sally, I never
saw a ghost in all my life, never! I thought they
were just make-believes, but if you saw one, of
course they&rsquo;re true. Do you s&rsquo;pose we could see
it again if we went out to look? Will you go with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I? I! Well, I guess not. Not a step will I
step&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But several steps I&rsquo;ll step, Mrs. Benton. I advise
the money going into the office safe, that old
Ephraim uses when he&rsquo;s at home. One of us better
camp out on the lounge in the room there till we
get rid of whoever&rsquo;s cash that is. I&rsquo;ll bunk there
myself, if you like, Mrs. Trent, after I step outside
and see if all&rsquo;s serene with my prisoner,&rdquo; said Samson,
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I go with you, Samson? May I, mother?&rdquo;
asked Jessica.</p>
<p>The mother&rsquo;s consent was somewhat reluctant, for
now she could not bear to have her darling out of
sight. Yet if anybody on earth was to be trusted
with so precious a charge it was the herder. Besides,
she was annoyed at this talk of &ldquo;ghosts,&rdquo; and
knew that the shortest way to convince Jessica how
nonsensical it was, would be by allowing her to
go out and seek for them herself.</p>
<p>But Samson answered cordially:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do me proud, little one. Suppose you take
your rifle, and then, if we see any specter you can
pin it to the mission wall, and we&rsquo;ll have a show,
charging ten pins&rsquo; admission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went out, laughing and gay; the child clinging
to the giant&rsquo;s hand, and hoping that she might
really see the phantom of Aunt Sally&rsquo;s story, for
she had no fear concerning it. They came back,
five minutes later, looking grave and seriously
alarmed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>THE PRISONER DISAPPEARS</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Trent, foreboding
fresh trouble, since, of late, trouble had become
so familiar a visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, the bird has flown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please explain, Samson,&rdquo; she anxiously urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bird of dark plumage&ndash;&ndash;Ferd, the dwarf.
He&rsquo;s escaped, vamoosed, took wings and flew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Samson! I&rsquo;m so sorry. I hoped you would
look after him until I could find some suitable
institution in which to place him. It&rsquo;s time he
should be helped, for if he&rsquo;s so sharp to do evil, he
must have equal capacity for better things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. So I allow; and I had them same
hopes myself, not ten minutes ago. I hadn&rsquo;t said
a word to anybody, but after you gave him to me,
I remembered what the little captain had commanded,
for it sort of struck home, that did. I
ain&rsquo;t overly saintlike, myself, but what of goodness
I&rsquo;d catched from you all I meant to pass on to the
coyote&ndash;&ndash;I mean, Ferdinand Bernal. I reckon it
was his face, &rsquo;stead of a ghost&rsquo;s, that Aunt Sally
saw by the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you locked him in some room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock and double-locked. Bolted, besides. Worst
is, all bolts and locks are just as I left &rsquo;em. Had
the key in my pocket and went in, saluting, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
there wasn&rsquo;t anybody to salute. Well, ma&rsquo;am, if
he&rsquo;s out, and &rsquo;twas him saw that money, there&rsquo;d
better two of us sleep beside it, rather than one.
He&rsquo;s the uncanniest creature ever I met, and I hope
never to meet his mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I do not see what harm he can do,
after all, except to himself, now. Jessica, dear,
please bring the key, and John can put this money
in the safe. If it weren&rsquo;t for Elsa&rsquo;s satisfaction, I
should regret that Pedro ever found it. Then we
must all to sleep. It&rsquo;s been a most eventful day,
and we are tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before long the whole household was asleep; but
the last to seek her rest was Mrs. Benton; nor did
she do that until she had locked whatever locks
would fasten, peeped under every bed, and invaded
the sacredness of Wun Lung&rsquo;s &ldquo;heatheny den.&rdquo; Then
she placed her Bible on one side her bed, a broom
and horsewhip on the other, and lay down to watch,
explaining:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to watch, even if I am resting
my body horizontal. I&rsquo;m so tired I can&rsquo;t set up
straight, nohow, and I shan&rsquo;t wink a wink till daylight
comes and the rest are moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having called out this valiant resolution to Mrs.
Trent, in the adjoining room, she instantly closed
her heavy lids, and opened them no more till a
series of thumps upon her shoulders aroused her.
Then she realized that Ned and Luis were reminding
her of yesterday&rsquo;s promise that, if they&rsquo;d eat no
more plum cake overnight they should have some
for their breakfasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land of love! What you doing? Is it daylight?
Why, &rsquo;twas dark as Egypt when I lay down, and
I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Can it be that I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;have overslept?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plum cake, Aunt Sally,&rdquo; reminded Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plumsally!&rdquo; cried Luis, with a forcible whack.
Which was instantly returned, and with such added
interest that he ran howling away, leaving the disturbed
matron to scold herself at leisure for her
lapse from duty, while she hurriedly dressed.</p>
<p>Naturally, she had to submit to some teasing on
account of her valiant resolution of the previous
night that she &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t wink a wink,&rdquo; but Mrs.
Trent was delighted that the faithful woman had,
at last, enjoyed a needed rest. Besides, everything
was bright at the ranch on that happy morning.
Even Wun Lung had caught the infection of Christmas
preparations, and was intent upon providing
some dainties of his own, against the approaching
festival, which should so far outshine the homelier
pies and puddings of Mrs. Benton, as his own
revered country outshone, in his opinion, even this
pleasant one in which, at present, his lot was cast.
He had also felt good-natured enough to put aside
a plentiful breakfast for his mate&ndash;&ndash;or foe&ndash;&ndash;of the
kitchen; and since it was such a time of happiness,
Aunt Sally condescended not only to eat it, but to
pronounce it &ldquo;good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this unexpected praise, the Chinaman
wound and unwound his precious queue, after a
fashion he had of expressing satisfaction; and smilingly
advised Mrs. Benton to &ldquo;step black polch,&rdquo;
where she would find things to do.</p>
<p>So to the back porch the good lady retreated,
carrying with her great dishes of fruit to prepare,
and not forgetting two enormous slices of the rich
plum cake she had promised the little boys, and
which would have made less active, hardily reared
children ill.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Trent had moved her sewing machine to the
porch, and Jessica sat near, with a little table before
her, trying to write the Christmas invitations that
had been so delayed, and to express them after a
style which should not too painfully expose her own
ignorance. The result was not so bad, considering
the slight training the child had had, and her few
years, yet it did not satisfy the mother, who felt
that education was the one good thing, and who
longed to have her child&rsquo;s bright intellect developed
as it should be.</p>
<p>Poor Jessica had written and rewritten the note
intended for Mr. Hale a number of times, and still
had it returned to her with many corrections, after
Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s reading of it, and now laid it aside with
a sigh of discouragement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t that wait a while, mother? If I may write
to my darling Ninian Sharp, I&rsquo;ll get myself rested.
He doesn&rsquo;t mind trifles like wrong capitals in the
right places&ndash;&ndash;oh! dear, I mean&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t know what
I mean. But may I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, dear. Though, first, come here and let
me try the length of this sleeve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Jess obeyed readily, for new clothes were
rare events in her simple life. This natty little
&ldquo;Christmas frock&rdquo; was white, with scarlet trimmings,
and quite sufficiently in contrast with the
plain blue flannel ones of everyday use to captivate
her fancy and make her patient under the tedious
process of &ldquo;fitting.&rdquo; Yet she was glad to return
to her table and her letter to Ninian Sharp, which
she found no difficulty in composing, since she was
free to do as she chose.</p>
<p>And this was the epistle which, after some delay,
reached the newspaper man, at a time when he happened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
to need cheering up, and brought new life
and interest into his overworked brain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;MY VERY DEAR MISTER SHARP: My

your Loving friend,</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;JESSICA TRENT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the letters were completed, the little captain
felt that she needed recreation, and her mother
agreed with her; but, unlike her former habit, could
not consent to the child&rsquo;s going anywhere alone.
The recent terrible experience had banished from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s heart that comfortable sense of security
which had prevented life on the isolated ranch
from being a lonely one. She now felt, as Aunt
Sally phrased it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of your own shadder, ain&rsquo;t you, Gabriell&rsquo;,
and well you may be. In the midst of life we are
in the hands of them Bernals, and no knowin&rsquo;. That
son John of mine may try to hoodwink me that
&rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t no ghost I saw last night, but ghost it was
if ever one walked this earth. It wasn&rsquo;t, so to
speak, a spooky ghost, neither; it was an avaricious
one, and it wasn&rsquo;t after no folks, but &rsquo;twas after
that money, sharp. Ain&rsquo;t disappeared, for good,
neither. Liable to spring up and out anywhere
happens; and you do well, Gabriell&rsquo;, not to trust our
girl off alone again. Not right to once. Where&rsquo;s
she hankerin&rsquo; to travel now? She&rsquo;d ought to be
learnt to sew patchwork, instead of riding all over
the country, hitherty-yender, a bareback on a
broncho or a burro. If she was my girl&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she was your girl, dear Aunt Sally, you
couldn&rsquo;t have been more anxious than you were
while she was lost. And the life is good for her.
It&rsquo;s right for all women to understand sewing and
household arts, but the captain isn&rsquo;t a woman yet,
and I have faith she&rsquo;ll acquire all fitting knowledge
in due time. She&rsquo;s anxious to ride to Pedro&rsquo;s. She
says there was something different in his manner,
last night, from ordinary, and, indeed, I fancied so
myself. She&rsquo;s gone to find which one of the boys
can best leave his work to ride with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be John Benton, Gabriella Trent. You see
if it ain&rsquo;t. That man just sees the world through
Jessica&rsquo;s eyes, and he&rsquo;s never got over being jealous
&rsquo;at he wasn&rsquo;t the one took her to Los Angeles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
that time. If he had all the work in creation piled
up before him, and she happened to say &lsquo;Come,&rsquo;
some other whither, whither, &rsquo;twould be, and not
a minute&rsquo;s hesitation. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s Marty&rsquo;s day
for mailridin&rsquo;, and there he lopes this instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ranchmen took turns in riding to the post,
each esteeming it a privilege, and finding nothing
but pleasure in the sixty miles&rsquo; gallop to Marion and
back. At that moment, indeed, Marty was swinging
out of sight on his own fine mount, the mailbag
before him on his heavy Mexican saddle, the wind
created by the swift motion of the beast raising
the brim of his broad hat and thrilling him with that
sense of abounding life and freedom which comes
so forcibly to men in the wide spaces of the earth.</p>
<p>He was the youngest of the &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; even though
past his first youth, and the &ldquo;life&rdquo; of the ranchmen&rsquo;s
quarters, where all liked and some loved him.</p>
<p>The women on the porch watched him till he became
a mere speck in the distance, and Aunt Sally
sighed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That George Cromarty is as likely a youth as
ever I knew. He&rsquo;s that good to his old mother,
back in the East, I tell my own son John, he ought
to profit by such an example. I should hate to have
anything happen to him. Yes, indeedy, I should hate
to have a single bad thing happen to poor George
Cromarty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little nervous shiver ran through Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s
slender frame, yet she turned upon her companion,
as she threaded her needle, with a laugh, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you dear old croaker! Why can&rsquo;t you let
well enough alone, without mentioning more evil?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
You know the old saying that to speak of trouble
is to invite its visitation. Surely, there was nothing
about to-day&rsquo;s postman to suggest disaster.
George is a typical ranchman, and my husband used
to point him out to visitors as what a man might
be, who grew up, or old, where &lsquo;there was room
enough.&rsquo; Big-hearted, full of fun, tender as a
woman, but intolerant of meanness and evil doing.
It would be a dark day for Sobrante if ill befell our
&lsquo;Marty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Something&rsquo;s going to go
wrong somewhere. I feel it in my bones, seems
if. There, I told you so! Yonder comes that lazy
boy of mine and Jessie. There&rsquo;s more things needing
him here on this place than you could shake a
stick at, yet off he&rsquo;ll go traipsing just at a nod
from his captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begrudge them their happiness, Aunt Sally.
Certainly, after grief, it is their due. Well, John,
will you act escort for the little lady of Sobrante?&rdquo;
asked its mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I not? And do me proud. She ain&rsquo;t to be
trusted with any of the flighty ones, Samson now,
or&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s laughter&ndash;&ndash;that morning as heart-whole
and free as a girl&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;interrupted the ranchman&rsquo;s
disparaging comments on his fellows, sedate
grayheads as most of them were; for well she understood
the universal devotion of all to their darling
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John, I can scarcely associate the idea of
frivolity or carelessness with our big Samson; but
wait a moment, please, before you start. There&rsquo;s
such a store of good things left, though in fragments,
that I&rsquo;d like to pack a basket for Pedro. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
wish he did not insist upon living so alone. He
is so old and I feel, as the native Californians used,
that the older a person grew the more precious. I
wish you&rsquo;d try to persuade him to let somebody
else take his place with the sheep, and to arrange
his small affairs so that when he comes down for
his Navidad he will remain. There&rsquo;s enough to keep
him busy and happy here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, mistress. But he&rsquo;ll not be persuaded.
Old Pedro wouldn&rsquo;t think he could breathe down
here in the valley, for long at a time. Well, good-by.
Ready, captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready, John, as soon as mother gets the basket.
Quiet, Buster. I believe you&rsquo;re more eager for a
canter than I am, even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then when the basket had been handed up to
John, the pair merrily saluted the women on the
porch and rode away; but Mrs. Benton called shrilly
after them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn back and start over again! Turn back, I
say! Both your horses set off left feet first. That
means bad luck as sure as you are born!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But nobody paid any heed to Aunt Sally&rsquo;s forecasts
of evil, save to laugh at them. Only Mrs.
Trent again felt that nervous shiver seize her, and
but for shame&rsquo;s sake would have begged her daughter
to defer her ride until another day.</p>
<p>However, shame prevailed; or common sense,
which is far better; and well it was&ndash;&ndash;or ill&ndash;&ndash;that the
riders kept serenely on their way, indifferent to
&ldquo;signs&rdquo; and ignorant of what lay before them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>ON THE ROAD HOME</h3>
</div>
<p>The train from Los Angeles rolled slowly up to
the little station at Marion and the asthmatic engine
seemed to wheeze its relief that its labor was
ended, as an old man stepped from the last car
and looked eagerly along the platform. Then a
certain degree of disappointment overspread his
fine face, and shouldering a heavy parcel, strapped
round with leather to give a holding place, he strode
rather unsteadily forward over the same sandy
road, or street, which had tried Ninian Sharp&rsquo;s
patience on his first visit to the post town.</p>
<p>Yet, after a little, the man grew accustomed to
his own stiffness of limb and moved with a sort of
halting swiftness which soon brought him to the
little hostelry of one Aleck McLeod, where a group
of ranchmen were sunning themselves while they
waited the distribution of the mail.</p>
<p>It was noticeable that the porch was spotlessly
clean and that none of the idlers profaned its cleanliness
by so much as one expectoration of tobacco
juice, though all were either smoking or chewing
that weed. They had far too great respect for
Janet, Aleck&rsquo;s wife, and for the labor that cleanliness
meant in that waterless region. They were all
deep in the discussion of the late events at Sobrante
and none heard the old traveler&rsquo;s approach over the
soft ground, till he stood close beside them with
his foot on the lower step.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>But he heard them and their eager talk; and,
pausing a bit, the more completely to surprise them
by an intended halloo, he forgot that and all else
save what they were saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was ten to one she was never found. &rsquo;Pears
like a miracle to me, that old Pedro was led to find
that very cave just when he did. My wife claims
it was a miracle, same as used to be in Bible days,
and you can&rsquo;t talk her out of it. You know how
women are,&rdquo; said one ranchman, who had aided in
the search for Jessica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first and last, them Trents have done a
heap for this section of our &lsquo;native.&rsquo; And they&rsquo;re
square folks, every identical of them. Even the
little tacker, that boy Ned. There&rsquo;s more in his
head than he gets credit for, and one these days he&rsquo;ll
show there is. He&rsquo;s a master hand with a gun,
baby as he is, and if he&rsquo;d had one handy I wager
he&rsquo;d have put some shot into the ugly carcass of
that Ferd&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; But he hadn&rsquo;t the iron and he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
added another smoker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a prime spread Mis&rsquo; Trent gave us. Must
have took about all the provisions she had in store,
but nothing was too good for them that helped her
in her trouble. Or tried to help, same thing; since
it was her own man, Pedro, found the child. Away
down in the bottom of a pit in the depth of an unknown
cave! Think of it, somebody! It just makes
my hair rise on end, known&rsquo; there is such a fool and
scoundrel joined in one dwarf&rsquo;s body&ndash;&ndash;Hello! hel&ndash;&ndash;lo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last speaker&rsquo;s words ended in a sort of
screech of astonishment and recognition, as a hard
hand was laid upon his shoulder, and Ephraim Marsh
demanded, fiercely:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say, neighbor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, Marsh! Where&rsquo;d you drop from?&rdquo;
cried one, rising and extending a hand in greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a sight to cure sick folks!&rdquo; shouted another,
pressing to &ldquo;Forty-niner&rsquo;s&rdquo; side, and slapping
the veteran&rsquo;s shoulder in high good will.</p>
<p>But Ephraim had no feeling at present, save anxiety
to know what their discussion had meant; and,
all talking, they laid a succinct history of the last
few days before him. He listened in increasing
alarm and amazement and his old limbs tottered
beneath him, so that he called out, hastily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a seat, somebody, quick, before I fall.
I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;to think of my little gell&ndash;&ndash;my own sweet-faced,
lovin&rsquo; little gell&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Oh, I can&rsquo;t believe it!
I can&rsquo;t and I won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s some plaguey Californy
yarn&rsquo; you&rsquo;re passin&rsquo; the time with. Atlantic! But
you might have chose a likelier subject to fool over,
you might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Aleck himself had seen the arrival through
the window and came out to greet him with the
heartiness accorded all the Sobrante people, and to
assure him that the story was all true; and that,
after all, it were better that he had not been at
home when the trouble came; &ldquo;for it would have
broke your heart, &lsquo;Forty-niner,&rsquo; into more pieces
than old Stiffleg broke your bones, and it wouldn&rsquo;t
have healed so soon, neither. But, come in, come in,
boy, and have a mouthful of dinner. Janet has as
fine a dish of haggis as ever I tasted in Aberdeen
at home, and it should relish to you, after all that
hospital fare and so on. Janet! Janet! Here&rsquo;s
Ephraim Marsh! Come welcome him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Janet came quickly, like her husband cordial
and sympathetic, and led the deeply moved frontiersman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
into her own kitchen, where no uninvited
ranchman dared intrude, and there served him well
with good things, including the haggis. And as
she served she talked in a wise, womanly way that
soothed his agitation and turned his thoughts from
enmity against the dwarf into thanksgiving that
now all was well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For since it is over and done with we can reckon
the gain. The sweet bit bairnie has won for herself
fresh friends. In all the countryside there was
but one feeling, &lsquo;The child must be found.&rsquo; No other
thing was of any moment, and found she was, by
a man so much older than any of the rest that nobody,
not even you, can grudge him the honor.
More hot milk? Oat cake? Nothing? Well, well;
for a man that&rsquo;s traveling you&rsquo;ve a small appetite.
Must be off already and pack your own bundle?
Why, friend, you would better leave that till one the
boys rides up for the mail. Due before this, indeed,
for Sobrante ranchers are ever keen for their post
stuff. No? A horse, then? Aleck was going to do
a bit of plowing with her, later on, but he&rsquo;ll eagerly
give over that for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ephraim felt that he could delay for nothing
more, not even for the arrival of a Sobrante messenger;
and as for Jean, the sorrel mare&ndash;&ndash;he and
she were old acquaintances, and he declined her
services with a grim smile, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Janet, it&rsquo;s kindly offered, but I&rsquo;m
in haste and I&rsquo;d rather trust my own lame leg than
her four lagging ones. Besides, if Aleck has been
afield in this search he&rsquo;ll be behindhand in his work,
and he&rsquo;s a hand to keep things up to the level line.
Good-by, good-by. Oh! wait a bit, though. I&rsquo;d
clean forgot that I put a scrap of white Scotch linen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
and a yard or two of plaid bodice stuff in my pack
for you. This business of my captain getting lost
has shaken my wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Janet protested against the trouble her
face glowed at prospect of her gifts, and as she
assisted him to unstrap and refasten his canvas sack,
and even begged to be shown the simple remembrances
he had procured for everybody he knew
&ldquo;at home;&rdquo; not least among them being calicoes
of brilliantly unwashable colors for Aunt Sally&rsquo;s
patchwork. Then he set off alone, staff in hand,
stolidly yet swiftly covering the ground with that
halting stride of his that soon took him out of
sight.</p>
<p>The assembled ranchmen received their own mail
matter, mounted and rode away; and there settled
over the little town that monotonous quiet which
would not be broken again until the arrival of the
evening train, when, possibly, some chance passenger
might alight on the deserted platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ephraim was passing over the level
road toward &ldquo;home,&rdquo; feeling keener delight and
longing with each step&rsquo;s advance, and when he came
to a little branch trail, where a rude signpost stated
the fact that he had come &ldquo;Five miles from Marion,&rdquo;
he made his first halt, sitting to rest for a few
moments under the eucalyptus trees bordering the
arroyo. The branch road led to and disappeared
among a group of buildings, some distance to the
north, on the ranch of one Miguel Solano, a friend
of Antonio Bernal, and a Mexican of ill-repute. The
ranch was comparatively new and was rich in olive
orchards and all the conveniences for producing a
fine quality of oil, and had been bought and arranged
by an easterner with all the accessories of profitable
farming. Death had put an end to the settler&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
industry, and the property had come, at a low figure,
into Solano&rsquo;s hands; whereupon everything industrious
lapsed, neglect and discomfort usurping the
place of thrifty comfort.</p>
<p>Gazing toward this place, Ephraim reflected that;
&ldquo;If that Greaser had half as much snap as he has
wickedness he&rsquo;d be a rich man. As &rsquo;tis, honest
folks sort of give Solano&rsquo;s a wide berth. I&rsquo;m thirsty
as a dog and wouldn&rsquo;t mind havin&rsquo; a drink out that
artesian well they have there, but&ndash;&ndash;Atlantic!
There&rsquo;s somebody already stoopin&rsquo; over it; looks
mighty familiar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old man stood up and shielded his eyes
with his hand as he peered into the distance, ending
his scrutiny with a shake of his fist in the
direction he had gazed, and muttering aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m better off here. Queer how you can
recognize a snake, no matter how far off! That&rsquo;s
Ferd, the dwarf; and if I was near enough to touch
him I couldn&rsquo;t keep my fingers off his dirty throat,
nohow, till I&rsquo;d choked the life out of him! Ugh!
When I think&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; But I mustn&rsquo;t think. I must
just get up and jog on till I see a prettier sight
than that. If I can spy the hunchback at one mile
off I can see my little captain&rsquo;s bonny head at ten.
Home, old &lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo;! Home&rsquo;s the word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if the thought of Jessica had put new strength
into his body Ephraim again shouldered his pack and
started forward; but he had proceeded a short
distance only when he again halted and this time
in consternation. On the road before him, where
it dipped slightly into a hollow, lay the prostrate
figure of a man, face downward in the dust; and
from the shrubbery near by came the helpless
floundering of some big animal and its occasional
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
cry of distress, than which there is no sound more
pitiful in all the world.</p>
<p>Away flew the pack, and Ephraim bent over the
man, gently turning him over, and crying in fresh
dismay:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Marty! George Cromarty, of all men, dead
as a doornail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas! Ephraim&rsquo;s home-coming was proving anything
but the delight he had anticipated. To be
met first by the story of the trouble which had
visited Sobrante and now by this dreadful discovery
almost unnerved him; but he was a man of action
and his hand flew to Marty&rsquo;s breast to feel if his
heart still beat. With the other hand he softly
brushed the dust from the rigid features and rubbed
the colorless temples. After a second or two
his face brightened, and he cried aloud, as if the
other might hear and be cheered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you aren&rsquo;t a dead man, after all, Marty, my
lad! But I&rsquo;d give a heap, this minute, for a bit of
cold water to give you. And, Atlantic! I believe
I&rsquo;m losing my wits. &rsquo;Course, he&rsquo;s got it himself,
handy. All the boys carry a flask in their pockets,
even on the short ride to post, but Marty, being
teetotal, fills his with water and gets laughed at for
his notions. A mighty good notion it&rsquo;ll prove for
him if it saves his life, and here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raising Marty&rsquo;s lean body so that his head rested
on the fallen bundle, Ephraim secured the flask,
found it full, and began to moisten the white lips;
then, cautiously, to force a few drops down the
stiffening throat. Success soon crowned his efforts
since, fortunately, the ranchman was merely
stunned, not killed, by the ugly fall he had taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
when his horse so suddenly pitched forward and
tossed him overhead against the pile of rocks.</p>
<p>For it was a horse in agony which sent that moving
appeal from the thicket near by, and as soon
as &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; was sure that the man was recovering,
though he could not as yet speak, he
sought the poor beast and saw, to his distress, that
for it there was no respite save in death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well! This is a bad job all round,
but better a horse than a man, and lucky for both
I came when I did. If I had a gun I&rsquo;d end the
misery of one, straight off. And maybe Marty has.
I&rsquo;ll look and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the road he was greeted by a prolonged
stare from the dazed ranchman, who had,
indeed, been able to drag his body to a sitting posture,
but vainly sought to understand what had
happened.</p>
<p>Ephraim spoke to him, asking in a matter-of-fact
tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a revolver with you, lad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? W-h-a-t?&rdquo; returned Marty, wonder drawing
upon him at finding who his companion was.
&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;Eph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course. Who else! Been quite a spell since
we two met, but better late than never. Got a
pistol, I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sharpshooter hesitated, then gave an evasive
answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powerful long since I done any practicin&rsquo;, and
feel like I better try my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant there was another heavy floundering
behind the bushes and another brutish moan of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
pain. With this full consciousness came to the injured
ranchman and he tried to rise, crying in his
own distress:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Comanche!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; gravely nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hurt?&rdquo; demanded Marty, as if he defied the
answer to be affirmative.</p>
<p>Ephraim turned away his face. To them, horses
were almost as human beings, and the love of a
master for his beast was something fraternal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me to him,&rdquo; said the ranchman, staggering
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not, lad. Best trust to me,&rdquo; protested the
elder man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust&ndash;&ndash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look in Ephraim&rsquo;s eyes was all the answer
needed to this fierce question, and Marty turned
away his own gaze as he faltered the next one:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mate, but take it like a man. Better him
than you, and&ndash;&ndash;give me the gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marty straightened and stiffened himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me to him. Something&rsquo;s wrong with my
legs. I&rsquo;ll see for myself. If it must be, I&rsquo;ll do it
for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frontiersman understood the sentiment and
respected it. He had had to do a like hard duty
for his own horseflesh before that, and he had always
felt it a sort of murder. He did not look at
Marty&rsquo;s face as he carefully guided his wavering
steps into the thicket and the presence of the suffering
Comanche, where one look sufficed his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>For an instant the tall head stooped to the level
of the struggling animal, and a strange, expressive
look passed between the great equine eyes and the
misty ones of the man. Then Marty&rsquo;s hand went
swiftly around to his pocket, there was the click
of a weapon, a flash and report, and Comanche
moved no more.</p>
<p>More shaken and ill from this deed than from his
terrible fall, Marty sat long in silence by Ephraim&rsquo;s
side beneath the eucalyptus trees; then suddenly
rousing, exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to find out the cause!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not far to seek, though difficult to understand.
Of all men in that countryside, gay, big-hearted
George Cromarty had most friends and
fewest enemies. He took life lightly, merrily, with
a good word for the virtues of others and silence
for their vices; yet there before them, unmistakably
plain, was the trap that had been set for his life.
A pit had been dug across the whole width of the
road, shallow, indeed, but sufficiently deep to throw
any horse passing over it. Its top had been screened
with interlacing twigs, over which had been scattered
soil and dust enough to hide them. One who
rode with his eyes on the ground, as Antonio used,
might easily, perhaps, have discovered the fiendish
work; but he who rode with head upraised and his
gaze on the distance would ride to his ruin as Marty
had done. To make the treachery more secure,
some sprays of wild grapes had been tightly
stretched beneath the whole, and this showed a deliberation
of evil that turned Ephraim sick, but the
other man furious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did that will pay the price! I swear it!&rdquo;
he cried.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It surely was meant for a Sobrante man, for
they&rsquo;re few besides who ride this way,&rdquo; answered
&ldquo;Forty-niner,&rdquo; thoughtfully. &ldquo;And, Atlantic! Here&rsquo;s
the mail pouch! Maybe &rsquo;twas robbery, pure and
simple. Was it a money day, for supplies or such?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon it was. The mistress herself locked and
gave the bag to me, bidding me be careful. As if
I was ever careless; but there was one letter in
it I heard about, that the little captain wrote to
Ninian Sharp. Wrote herself, an invite to the
Christmas doings. Try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Examination proved that the bag had been tampered
with, though the lock was a spring and now
securely fastened; but a small leather flap, intended
to cover the keyhole, had been torn from its fastenings
and lay on the ground. The pouch itself had
been flung slightly out of the way, under the bushes,
as if the trespasser had satisfied himself with and
concerning it and had no further use for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there used to be three keys to this concern.
One the mistress has; one the postmaster
keeps at the office; and the other was Antonio&rsquo;s,
since he always was wanting to open and put something
extra in the bag after Mrs. Trent had done
with it. I never liked the look of that, and it&rsquo;s my
opinion that it&rsquo;s the very key has unlocked this
bag, if unlocked it&rsquo;s been. Which is more&rsquo;n likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cromarty&rsquo;s head was again beginning to grow
dizzy, and he sat again upon the rock to recover
himself, making no answer to Ephraim&rsquo;s words
than the exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I going to get that bag to post in time?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>THE PASSING OF OLD CENTURY</h3>
</div>
<p>Jessica and her escort, John Benton, rode swiftly
up the canyon trail and over the brow of the mesa
toward the shepherd&rsquo;s cabin; but they had not proceeded
far along the upland before a sense of the
strangeness of things oppressed them both.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s keen eye detected the neglect of the sheep,
which were still huddled in the corral, though long
past their hour for pasturage; while their bleating
expressed hunger as well as dislike of their unusual
imprisonment. But Jessica saw first the abject
attitude of the collie, Keno, who came reluctantly
to greet them with down-hanging head and
tail and a reproachful upward glance of his brown
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you poor doggie! What&rsquo;s happened you?
You look as if you&rsquo;d been beaten. Where&rsquo;s your
master, good Keno? Keno, where&rsquo;s Pedro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian was nowhere visible, and as if he fully
understood the question, the collie answered by a
long, lugubrious whine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong. That&rsquo;s as plain as preachin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
cried John, and hurried to the little house,
whose door stood open, but about which there was
no sign of life.</p>
<p>He had tossed his bridle to the captain, meaning
that if aught were amiss within she should be detained
for the present by holding the horses. However,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
she saw through this ruse, and, leaping from
Buster, swiftly hobbled both animals and ran after
the carpenter.</p>
<p>Keno kept close at her heels, the very presentment
of canine misery, and uttering at every few
steps that doleful whine which was so unusual to
him. But, arrived at the cabin, he left her and with
one bound had reached the Indian&rsquo;s side, where he
still sat beside his window, his head against its casing
and his blanket&ndash;&ndash;Jessica&rsquo;s gift&ndash;&ndash;closely wrapped
about him. He did not move when they entered,
nor respond even by objection to the collie&rsquo;s frantic
blandishments, but John raised his hand for silence,
as she stood sorrowfully gazing downward upon
the face of death.</p>
<p>Yes, it was that. He had more than rounded his
century of years, he had lived uprightly, as the good
padres had taught; he had bestowed upon those he
loved the secret of great wealth, and he had gone to
keep his precious Navidad in the home of eternal
youth.</p>
<p>Jessica comprehended the truth at once, and her
eyes filled with the tears which, as yet, did not
overflow; for as she gazed upon the sleeper&rsquo;s face
it filled her with amazement and something akin to
delight; and at last she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how young and glad he looks! He&rsquo;s even
nobler than he was when he rode away from me
last night, and I&rsquo;d never seen him so dignified and
grand as he was then. It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s as if he had done
with everything is hard, like worries, and evil, and
loneliness, and&ndash;&ndash;all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, lassie; he has done with all&ndash;&ndash;that you or I
know aught about; and every inch a man he seems
as he sits there in the majesty of death.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>By then the child&rsquo;s tears had begun to flow, and
she caught up Pedro&rsquo;s hand with an outburst of
grief and love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor Pedro! To have been here all alone
when it came! What shall I do without him who
was always so good, so good to me? Oh, I can&rsquo;t
have it so, John! I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was wise enough to attempt no consolation,
knowing well how small a part of her life the venerable
Indian had been and how easily youth accustoms
itself to such a loss. But, after he had allowed
her to sob for a time, he gently touched her shoulder,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come. Pedro has finished his work and has
passed it on to us. Those poor sheep must be cared
for, and somebody must ride home at once; or,
rather, should ride at once to Marion to make the
necessary arrangements. I wish&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; And he
paused in perplexity, regarding her as if in doubt
what was best to be done.</p>
<p>They left the cottage with that quiet tread which
seems natural in the presence of those whom no
sound can trouble, and, hand in hand, walked sadly
to the fold, where the penned sheep greeted them
with eager cries and restless movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pedro used to say they talked and he knew what
they said. I begin to believe he did, for, listen!
This sound isn&rsquo;t like that other first one, which told
us they were hungry. This says: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve
come!&rsquo; Doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it sounds to me, lassie; and I, too, am glad
we came. It&rsquo;s queer, though, how set you were
on it, even against the mistress&rsquo; wish that you should
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, John, I had to come. I just had to. And
this is what I think: When we&rsquo;ve taken care of the
sheep, we&rsquo;ll lay Pedro on his bed and lock the door.
Keno will keep guard, if we tell him; though whoever
comes here, anyway? Then you must ride to
Marion to see about&ndash;&ndash;about&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;here, for a moment,
grief interrupted her again, but she suppressed her
tears as soon as possible and went on quite calmly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;about
what always has to be at such a time. I
remember&ndash;&ndash;I remember it all when my father&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;No,
no, John, I&rsquo;m not going to cry again. I won&rsquo;t
make bad worse, never, if I can help it. But this
I say: You ride to Marion and send word to the
mission so that a priest may come; and do all the
rest. I will ride home and the boys will come up
and fetch him to Sobrante. It must be in the little
old chapel that we never use, because my father said
he would not put to a common service a room that
had once been given to God. Pedro always loved it.
It was there he used to say his &lsquo;devotions&rsquo; and there
he must lie&ndash;&ndash;in state&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t that what they call it
when great folks die? Pedro was great. He had
lived so very long and he had always been so devout.
What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I say, little captain, but that you&rsquo;ve a
long head on your young shoulders, and I&rsquo;m sorry
this load of grief had to rest on it so early. More
than that; I undertook to be your guardeen to-day,
and I&rsquo;ve no notion of shirking the job&ndash;&ndash;even now.
I passed my word to the &lsquo;admiral&rsquo; that I&rsquo;d fetch
you home safe, and so I will. It won&rsquo;t take much
longer and it&rsquo;s right. Home first, and Marion afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe, that is best; and surely it is pleasantest.
I didn&rsquo;t want to be selfish, but I&rsquo;d rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
you stayed with me. Are you ready? Shall we
leave him just as he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. We&rsquo;ll close the window and the door,
and then&ndash;&ndash;home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was with widely different feelings that
they cantered down the canyon from those with
which they had ridden up it, and when she saw them
returning so soon and so swiftly, Mrs. Trent went
out to meet them, saying nothing, indeed, yet asking
the question with her eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What trouble now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then John told their story speedily and suggested
that some of the men ride to the mesa and attend
to what was needful. Also, repeated Jessica&rsquo;s opinion
about the chapel, with which the lady instantly
agreed; then, clasping her daughter&rsquo;s hand very
close, returned with her to the porch and began to
fold away her sewing.</p>
<p>But both Aunt Sally, when she came and heard
the news, and the little girl asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you put it away, mother, dear? If
Pedro is happy now, as we believe, why shouldn&rsquo;t
we be, too? All the rest must have their holiday,
and I think&ndash;&ndash;I think he&rsquo;d like to have me look nice.
He always did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jessie is right, Gabriell&rsquo;. Things do happen terrible
upsettin&rsquo; lately, seems to me; but by the time
you and me get to be a hundred odd, I reckon we
shan&rsquo;t care a mite whether folks wear red and white
dresses or horrid humbly ones. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; on just the
same as ever, for that&rsquo;s the only way I&rsquo;ll ever keep
my common senses in this spooky place. I knew
when they two started off, left hoof foremost, they
was ridin&rsquo;, to trouble; and this morning my hen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
chicken crowed to beat any rooster I ever heard, and
that&rsquo;s a sure sign of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sally, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; protested Mrs. Trent, glancing
anxiously at her daughter&rsquo;s face. But she need
not have feared; for the child smiled back upon her,
serene and happy, despite the traces of tears that
still marked her bright eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, mother, dear; and I&rsquo;m thinking
how glad Pedro must be now, to have found all
those he&rsquo;d so long outlived. He just went to sleep,
you see, alone, and waked up with them around
him. I think it was beautiful&ndash;&ndash;beautiful; and his
last deed was to find me and to tell you how you
could grow rich if you want to. Where are the
little boys, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They presently appeared, in wild excitement, having
been at the men&rsquo;s quarters when John rode
thither to impart his news and directions; yet in this
excitement was not a vestige of grief. They seemed
to feel relieved of some dread, and Ned more than
once punched Luis, whispering shrilly enough for
all to hear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do it now, and not get caught! Yes,
siree! We can do it now! Don&rsquo;t you tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Luis responded by an ecstatic hug and the
customary echo:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it now; don&rsquo;t you tell! Yes, siree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Benton had nearly covered the distance
to Marion, when he perceived two men slowly advancing
toward him along the level road. For a
moment, engrossed by thoughts of recent happenings,
he paid slight attention to the fact, though
idly wondering what strangers might be having
business, and on foot, with Sobrante, at which point
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
the road ended. But, as he drew nearer to them,
something familiar in the bearing of the taller man,
and startling in the appearance of the other, caused
him to shield his eyes from the sunshine and peer
critically into the distance. Then he slapped his
thigh so excitedly that his horse suddenly stopped,
reared and nearly unseated him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you idiot! Can&rsquo;t a feller slap himself without
your takin&rsquo; it to heart? If I ain&rsquo;t a blind man,
and maybe I am, that&rsquo;s old &lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo; hoofing
himself home, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Whew! That&rsquo;s Marty,
limpin&rsquo; and leanin&rsquo; alongside. Well, I &rsquo;low! More
trouble and plenty of it. Seems if all creation was
just a-happenin&rsquo; our way, blamed if it don&rsquo;t. Giddap
there, Moses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes he had reached the pedestrians
and saluted them with unfeigned astonishment, and
Ephraim with great friendliness of expression, but
also the question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fresh calamities you two fetchin&rsquo;, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They told him, as briefly as possible, and he found
his own perplexity increased as he demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in creation is to be done? Here&rsquo;s Pedro
gone and died in the most unhandy place and time;
and here be you two, with not a decent leg between
you, twenty miles from home, and one horse for the
three of us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the word &ldquo;horse&rdquo; poor Marty winced, as from
a personal blow, while both he and Ephraim were
greatly amazed at the news of the shepherd&rsquo;s death.
They began to feel, as John had said, that &ldquo;nothing
save disaster was meant for Sobrante folks;&rdquo; yet,
after a moment, &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; perceived another
side of the matter, and expressed himself thus:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got into the pack of us? Seems if we&rsquo;d
lost our gumption. After all, couldn&rsquo;t anything have
happened likelier, so far forth as I see. John Benton,
you light off Moses and help this man into your
saddle. He&rsquo;ll ride home and I&rsquo;ll walk alongside,
whilst you tramp on to Marion. There&rsquo;s a mare
there, named Jean. She was offered to me, but I
was in a hurry and didn&rsquo;t accept. However, the
offer is due to hold good for any of our folks. Light,
I tell you. Marty&rsquo;s about played out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the respite came none too soon. The
worst injury the gardener had sustained was, apparently,
of the head, and a terrible dizziness rendered
his progress on foot almost impossible. He
would not have been able to accomplish this much
of the journey, save for the continual help of
Ephraim, who was himself burdened with the heavy
pack and unwilling to relinquish it.</p>
<p>John stepped down and swung his fellow ranchman
up to Moses&rsquo; back; then placed the bundle before
the rider, turned the animal&rsquo;s head toward
Sobrante, and chirruped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giddap! Home&rsquo;s the word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moses needed no second urging, but was off at a
gallop, leaving the others to discuss the situation
a bit further, and Ephraim to follow at his leisure.</p>
<p>There was little more to be said, however, and
soon each was pursuing diverging routes and each
at his swiftest pace.</p>
<p>At Marion, John had the mail pouch unlocked and
examined, and was satisfied that some letters had
been tampered with. These contained orders for
house supplies and had been accompanied by checks,
as was evident from the wording of the orders. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
checks had been removed, and this fact proved to
the carpenter that the hand of Antonio Bernal was
in the matter, because the late manager might indorse
them without arousing the bank&rsquo;s suspicion,
as nobody else could.</p>
<p>Yet there was one thing he did not mention, even
to the postmaster; and that was the package which
Jessica&rsquo;s letter to Ninian Sharp had spoken of. This
had disappeared entirely. The fact troubled him
more than the loss of the checks, for he could
stop the payment of these, but whether the little
captain had sent the whole of their only specimen of
the copper to her city friend or not was a serious
question.</p>
<p>However, he did what he could; and almost for
the first time in his life used the telegraph as well
as the post. To pay for his long and rather ambiguous
messages he borrowed money of the mystified
Aleck McLeod; and the local operator found
himself busier than he had ever been since the
establishment of the office.</p>
<p>The other sad business that had brought him to
the town was also transacted; and by the time
all was arranged John was very glad to avail himself
of Jean&rsquo;s services, slow though she was. Upon
her sedate back he arrived at Sobrante, just as the
sun was setting, and found that the household had
temporarily forgotten their grief for Pedro in their
rejoicing over Ephraim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an up and a down in this world,&rdquo; quoth
Aunt Sally, spreading and admiring the brilliant
bits of calico which &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; had given her.
&ldquo;Life ain&rsquo;t all catnip anyway you stew it. Them
that laugh in the morning gen&rsquo;ally cry before night,
and vicy-versy. But, Gabriella, do, for goodness&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
sake, just fetch out that queer kind of stick that old
Indian made a sort of graven image of and show it
to Mr. Ma&rsquo;sh. It&rsquo;s a curiosity, being so old, if it
ain&rsquo;t no more. Worth cherishin&rsquo;, anyhow, &rsquo;count of
him that give it. I always did admire keepsakes of
the departed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent smiled, though sadly, and Jessica
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I get it, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. For safety I put it on the top of the
tallest bookcase, behind the files of newspapers.
You&rsquo;ll likely have to take the little library ladder
to reach it; and when you&rsquo;ve shown it, put it back in
exactly the same spot. It&rsquo;s doubly valuable now,
and could not be replaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little captain had scarcely once relinquished
the hand of her beloved sharpshooter, since he appeared
before them all, and now led him, as if he
were another happy playmate, to the designated
place. But when she had reached it, mounted the
ladder and carefully felt all over the top of the
case, even moving the files in order to examine it
the better, she could not find the metal-pointed staff.</p>
<p>Standing on the floor beneath, Ephraim watched
her face growing sober and disappointed, as she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone! It&rsquo;s completely gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has, dearie? Well, maybe your mother forgot
and put it somewhere else. The likeliest thing in
the world to happen, with her mind so upset as it
has been. We&rsquo;ll go back and ask her. Don&rsquo;t fret.
Probably it wasn&rsquo;t of much account, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but, dear Ephraim, it was! It could point
the way to our big fortune that&rsquo;s to be dug out of
the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What? What is that you say, child? Nonsense.
We don&rsquo;t live in the days of witchcraft, and that&rsquo;s
what such a performance would mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet when they had returned to Mrs. Trent and
related their misadventure he was startled by hearing
that sensible woman tragically exclaim, in contradiction
to his own assertion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost! Then Sobrante is certainly bewitched!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>THE REBELLION OF THE LADS</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank my stars, I haven&rsquo;t lost my faculty of
doing two things to once, nor seein&rsquo; a dozen!&rdquo; cried
Aunt Sally, as if in response to Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s exclamation.
Then she rose so hastily that her beloved
&ldquo;pieces&rdquo; fell on the floor and her spectacles
slid from the end of her nose, their habitual resting
place. &ldquo;There never was witches on this ranch
before, and I reckon I can deal with a few of them
that&rsquo;s here now. Edward Trent, Luis Garcia!
Where you goin&rsquo; at? Hey? Hear me? Come
right straight back to me this minute, if you know
what&rsquo;s good for yourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All were surprised by this outburst and awaited
its result with curiosity.</p>
<p>The two little boys had been suspiciously quiet
on the farther end of that long porch where the
household practically lived. Mrs. Trent had glanced
their way, occasionally, but supposed them to be
engrossed by the patent whistle and top which had
been found in Ephraim&rsquo;s pack, neatly marked with
their respective names. Yet one could not eat tops
nor whistles, and their elbows had been seen, from
the rear, to move in a suggestive manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re eatin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; all this time. I wonder
what!&rdquo; had been Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s private reflection.
But when Jessica came back with her report of the
lost wand, the elbow action had suddenly ceased;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
and, after what appeared to be a brief whispered
consultation, they had slunk away down the path,
Ned trying to help Luis hide something within his
blouse, though not, apparently, succeeding.</p>
<p>At the sound of Aunt Sally&rsquo;s voice, indeed, they
dropped the box they had been secreting and burst
into a paroxysm of giggling, as was their customary
receipt of her chiding. The giggle was always destined
to end in tears, but this never prevented its
recurrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neddy Trent! If that bad little Garcia boy is
doing wrong, it&rsquo;s no need you should be naughty,
too. Come back here and show poor auntie what
you&rsquo;ve got in your blouses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wheedling had no more effect than scolding, for
with one hug of each other&rsquo;s necks, the children
scampered onward, leaving their spoils behind
them.</p>
<p>Then Jessica followed to see what this might be,
and exclaimed, in some surprise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candy! Where did it come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, it happened that such sweets, except of
homemade manufacture and on rare occasions,
were forbidden the lads, because they were always
made ill by them. That is, Luis suffered and Ned
was not allowed anything his playmate could not
share. All the ranchmen knew Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s wishes
on the subject and heretofore none had ever gone
against them. Who had done it now?</p>
<p>Of course, suspicion instantly pointed to &ldquo;Forty-niner,&rdquo;
who indignantly denied that he had brought,
or even thought of bringing, anything home which
his beloved mistress did not wish there.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anybody trust me any more about anything?&rdquo;
he concluded, wistfully.</p>
<p>The accusation had come from Mrs. Benton, but
Gabriella hastened to soothe the sharpshooter,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making mountains out of mole hills, I
fear. There, Aunt Sally, never mind. They have
left so much behind them on the path that they
can hardly have eaten enough to harm them, anyway.
Let them go, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the good woman would not drop the subject.
Her sharp eyes had not been given her for nothing,
and her son always asserted that if his mother had
been a man she would have made a first-class detective.
Panting and puffing in her haste and
curiosity, she hurried to the spilled confections and
carefully picked them up; then returned to the
porch, significantly holding forth, upon her palm, a
specimen of what she had discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needn&rsquo;t tell me I didn&rsquo;t smell peppymint! Them&rsquo;s
them peppymint rounds with chocolate outsides
that I never seen nobody eat, on this ranch, &rsquo;cept
Antonio Bernal. They ain&rsquo;t kept in the store to
Marion, and the storekeeper used to send for &rsquo;em to
Los Angeles, &rsquo;specially for his one customer. I
know, Antonio offered me some, time and again, on
my other visits, but I always thanked him polite
and said no. I never did lay out to eat a snake&rsquo;s
victuals, and that&rsquo;s what his&rsquo;n was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a woman you are, Aunt Sally!&rdquo; laughed
Ephraim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I hope I be; enough of one, anyhow,
to see through a millstone, when there&rsquo;s a hole in
it. But you&rsquo;ve come back so peart and sassy, sharpshooter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
I reckon I best go steep you a fresh dose
of picra. After I&rsquo;ve learnt all them tackers can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t be stern with them, Aunt Sally,&rdquo;
protested the mother. &ldquo;Whatever they&rsquo;ve done is
but natural. It would be too much to expect them
to refuse such a treat if it were offered them, and,
maybe, John brought it to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John? My boy, John? After the raisin&rsquo; he had!
Well, you&rsquo;re on the wrong track there and I&rsquo;m on
the right one. Antonio Bernal, or some feller sneak
of his, has been here at Sobrante, and you needn&rsquo;t
touch to tell me he hasn&rsquo;t. Wait; I&rsquo;ll find out now!&rdquo;
she ended, in triumph, and again the others were
obliged to laugh, though Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s brief mirth
closed with a sigh, which Jessica heard and understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t you fear, mother, dear. Aunt Sally
wouldn&rsquo;t hurt either of them, really; and, indeed,
I don&rsquo;t know who would keep them in order if she
didn&rsquo;t try. What mischief one can&rsquo;t think of the
other does, and I&rsquo;ll run after her and see the thing
out. Who knows but that they can tell us something
about the missing staff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The runaways had made a detour by way of the
kitchen, and adjoining the kitchen was the &ldquo;cold
closet,&rdquo; which was the refuge they sought, and
where already were stored some of the Christmas
goodies. This closet had but one door and a securely
shuttered window, and once the door was gained by
the pursuer she would have the small miscreants in
a trap. This she had seen and this it was which had
given her that triumphant expression.</p>
<p>The captain also gained the pantry door just after
it had closed behind Mrs. Benton and her prisoners,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
and to her repeated request to be admitted, received the
enigmatical answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time enough when I&rsquo;ve pumped these little cisterns
dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the children in there with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t hurt them, will you? Please don&rsquo;t punish
them to-day. I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which the grim jailer responded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go along back to &lsquo;Forty-niner,&rsquo; Jessie darlin,
and be happy. We&rsquo;re all mighty comfortable in here
and lots of good victuals, if so be we get hungry.
Plenty to drink, too, for I just brought in a crock of
fresh water to cool my eggs in. I&rsquo;ve got my knittin&rsquo;
work and am as happy as an oyster. Go back, for
I ain&rsquo;t ready to talk yet. When I am I&rsquo;ll come out
and bring these naughty children with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jessica returned to her old friend&rsquo;s side; and
in listening to his talk about the hospital and the
friends she had made there for herself, as well as
about Mr. Ninian Sharp and the lawyer, Morris
Hale, the evening quickly passed and bedtime came.</p>
<p>When the ranch mistress rose to say good-night,
she went to the still closed door of the closet, and
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming out now, Aunt Sally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady opened the door and pointed complacently
to a distant corner of the roomy apartment
where, upon a pile of soft blankets that had
been stored within, lay the two little boys, sound
asleep and the picture of innocent comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Gabriella, you see they&rsquo;re all right. I
wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a hair of their bonny heads, not for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
another ranch as fine as this one. But here them
and me stay till I worm the truth out of &rsquo;em about
that candy and that magic staff. Where that candy
come from that there staff has gone. You hear me
and believe me. Oh, I know what I know! Good-night.
Don&rsquo;t you worry. Me and them is all right,
as I said, and my head&rsquo;s level. I went to sleep
a-watchin&rsquo; t&rsquo;other time, but I shan&rsquo;t this. There&rsquo;s
more in my mind than nonsense. This chair is as
comfortable as a lounge. I slipped out and got it
from the settin&rsquo;-room when you all was talkin&rsquo; so
lively, just now, and we&rsquo;re fixed. I may come out
before daylight and I may stay till doomsday; but
come I shan&rsquo;t a single step, not to please even you
for whom I&rsquo;d do and dare a good deal, and don&rsquo;t you
doubt it, but when my mind is sot it&rsquo;s sot, and sot
it is this minute, an don&rsquo;t you dast to let on to John
Benton, or that sassy boy&rsquo;d plague the very life out
of me, and you go right along to your own bed and
take Jessie with you, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Trent stayed to hear no more. When
Aunt Sally got started on such a harangue as this,
exhaustion of breath was her only limit. The lady
did not anticipate more than an hour&rsquo;s further imprisonment
of the children, if so long, and was sure
that they would be even tenderly cared for, no matter
what their misdemeanors, if she did not herself
interfere. Yet daylight came and found the odd
trio still behind that closed door, and it opened only
at breakfast time; when, leading two very penitent-looking
small boys and herself wearing the air of
a Roman conqueror, Mrs. Benton emerged from her
seclusion upon an expectant household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Aunt Sally, haven&rsquo;t you &lsquo;wormed&rsquo; them, as
you promised? Poor little tackers! they&rsquo;ve lost
their pride and spirit, and I love them. Come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
sister, darlings, and get your morning hugs!&rdquo; cried
Jessica, as they appeared. Ephraim, close at hand,
winked at them solemnly and held up behind Mrs.
Benton&rsquo;s back two most alluring marbles. But they
did not wink in response, nor give more than a furtive
smile, as they reluctantly dragged along under
their guardian&rsquo;s forcible guidance. Her route was
direct to the watering trough where, without ado,
she promptly stripped, bathed and rubbed dry, each
shivering little figure. Then she reclothed and led
them back to the kitchen, placing them in high
chairs beside the big deal table, while she proceeded
to cook their oatmeal and serve it to them, with a
bad-as-you-are-you-shan&rsquo;t-starve sort of air which
would have amused Jessica, had she not so heartily
pitied her playmates.</p>
<p>After a time she could endure the sight no longer,
but sped to Ned&rsquo;s chair and clasped him fondly in
her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, brotherkin? Tell sister, do.
Is it nothing but that miserable candy? What else
have you done to make auntie so angry with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned&rsquo;s bosom heaved and a mighty sob burst forth.
But he instantly repressed this sign of weakness,
though unfortunately, not soon enough to prevent
Luis from echoing it with redoubled intensity.</p>
<p>Now nothing so quickly restores the self-possession,
even of grown-ups, as the sight of another&rsquo;s
collapse; and no sooner had Luis given vent
to his emotion than Ned&rsquo;s spirit returned to him.
Throwing back his pretty head, with an air of unconquerable
resolution, he reached forth and pounded
his mate smartly on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Luis Garcia, what you crying for? Isn&rsquo;t
none of your staffs, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t my old staffs, ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; sobbed the &ldquo;echo,&rdquo; for
such he was often nicknamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you needn&rsquo;t cry, you needn&rsquo;t. I ain&rsquo;t crying,
I ain&rsquo;t. Hate old Aunt Sally. Hate &rsquo;Tonio. Hate
Ferd. Hate everybody. Give me my breakfast, old
Aunt Sally Benton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate Bentons!&rdquo; agreed Luis, and flung his arms
about his little tyrant&rsquo;s throat till he choked from
outward expression whatever more might have
issued thence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned! Why, Ned! I never, never knew you so
naughty! Do tell me; what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Benton glared at the culprit over her down-dropped
spectacles in a truly formidable manner,
but the result was only a settled stubbornness which
nothing moved.</p>
<p>Seeing that pleading was hopeless, at present,
and that Ned was in one of his dogged fits, Jessica
quietly walked away and began to help in the preparation
of the elder people&rsquo;s meal, as her mother
liked to have her do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aunt Sally waited upon the children,
piling their saucers with the tasty porridge, moistened
with Blandina&rsquo;s yellow cream and plentifully
sprinkled with sugar. They were healthy and unused
to grief, and the palatable food soon restored
their good humor. They seemed to forgive their
venerable tormentor and fell to their accustomed
scrimmage with the utmost enjoyment; and this
was pleasanter for all concerned. However, even
when they had eaten all they could and were ready
for outdoors and their morning fun, their plans were
nipped in the bud. Aunt Sally had a spare hand for
each of them and conducted them firmly to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
dining room and a place upon its lounge, while the
family took their own food in what comfort they
could.</p>
<p>This was not so great Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s eyes would
wander to the unhappy pair&ndash;&ndash;for they were once
more gloomy and unsubdued&ndash;&ndash;and old Ephraim cast
many glances thither, entreating by silent signals
that they should repent of whatever sin they had
committed and be restored to favor.</p>
<p>The meal past the family rose and, from her
pocket, Mrs. Benton produced two long strips of
cloth, one of which she fastened about each child&rsquo;s
wrist, leaving its other end to tie to her own apron
belt.</p>
<p>Then she turned to the mother, whose tears were
beginning to fall, and said, severely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriella, if I didn&rsquo;t love you as well as I love
myself and better, I&rsquo;d let these children go and no
more said. But they&rsquo;ve done that no punishin&rsquo; won&rsquo;t
reach, though maybe they&rsquo;ll give in after a spell.
I shan&rsquo;t hurt &rsquo;em nor touch to; but I shall keep
&rsquo;em tied to me till they tell me what I&rsquo;m bound to
know. So that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;ve got enough on your
hands, with this funeral business and all that&rsquo;ll
come, and however we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to feed another lot
of visitors so soon after them others, I declare I
don&rsquo;t see. And me with these tackers tied to my
apron strings, the way they be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent rose and left the room and Jessica
slowly followed. Neither of them could quite understand
Aunt Sally&rsquo;s present behavior, nor why she
should wish to bother herself with two such hindrances
to the labor which must be accomplished.</p>
<p>But Ephraim lingered. He simply could not endure
the sight of the little ones&rsquo; unhappiness, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
quietly slipping a knife from his pocket he coolly
cut their leading strings, caught them up in his
strong arms and limped away before their captor
had discovered her loss.</p>
<p>But he put his head back inside the doorway to
call out, reassuringly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begging pardon, Mrs. Benton, I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;spell&rsquo; you on
the &lsquo;worming out&rsquo; business and promise they shan&rsquo;t
leave my care till I hand &rsquo;em back to you thoroughly
&lsquo;pumped.&rsquo; Come along, laddies. I&rsquo;ve a mind to visit
every spot on this blessed ranch and&ndash;&ndash;upon one
condition&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve a mind to take you with me. Want
to hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. What is it?&rdquo; demanded Ned, already very
happy at the exchange of jailers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that you must explain what all this row
and rumpus is about with Aunt Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing at the top of the steps, with one foot
outstretched, old &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; paused and steadily
regarded the small face above his shoulder.</p>
<p>Ned returned the gaze with equal steadfastness,
as if he were pondering in his troubled mind the
best course to pursue. Then, because he might think
more clearly so, he lifted his serious gaze to the
distance; and, at once, there burst from his quivering
lips a cry of fear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see him! I see him! He&rsquo;s coming, like he
said&ndash;&ndash;to kill me&ndash;&ndash;to kill me! I dassent&ndash;&ndash;I dassent!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>NED&rsquo;S STORY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eels couldn&rsquo;t have done that slicker!&rdquo; commented
Ephraim, in surprise. For, behold! his arms
were empty and the flash of twinkling legs along
the garden path pointed whither his charges had
fled. &ldquo;Here they were and here they aren&rsquo;t, and
whatever scared them that way is more than I can
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, though he shaded his eyes with his hand
and made a prolonged examination of the outlook,
nothing different from ordinary was visible; and,
after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, he sought Aunt Sally
and reported:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Benton, I &rsquo;low I&rsquo;m doomed to that
dose of picra, for I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; You see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ephraim Ma&rsquo;sh, where&rsquo;s them children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just exactly what I&rsquo;d like to know myself,
neighbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! You needn&rsquo;t go &lsquo;neighborin&rsquo;&rsquo; me, if that&rsquo;s
all you&rsquo;re worth. Tryin&rsquo; fool capers like a boy, ain&rsquo;t
you? Think it was terr&rsquo;ble clever to cut strings that
I&rsquo;d took the trouble to tie and then settin&rsquo; them
youngsters free. Well, all I have to say is that
you&rsquo;ve done more harm than you can undo in a
hurry, and that&rsquo;s the true word,&rdquo; retorted the indignant
matron, beating a bowlful of eggs as she would
have enjoyed beating him just then.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>Ephraim crossed the kitchen and laid one hand on
her shoulder, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Sally, let&rsquo;s quit chasing about the bush.
There&rsquo;s something more in this nonsense than appears,
and if you&rsquo;re a true and loyal friend to this
family I&rsquo;m another as good. Two heads are better
than one, you know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if one belongs to a silly old feller like you?
H&rsquo;m Ephraim, you&rsquo;re right! There is somethin&rsquo;
more&rsquo;n shows outside. That candy was a bait, a
trap, a lure, a&ndash;&ndash;anything you choose; and I do hope
the little fellers are safer&rsquo;n I fear they be. If I catch
&rsquo;em again, for their good&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;My suz! Here
they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; back of their own free will and wonder
ain&rsquo;t ceased!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, as swiftly as they had scampered away,
the lads were returning and burst into the kitchen,
crying with what little breath they had left:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Sally, lock me up! Lock us up tight!
Quick&ndash;&ndash;quick! I seen him! He&rsquo;ll do it! My mother
says Antonio always does do things, he does!
Quick, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock up, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned and the echo swung round behind the
matron&rsquo;s capacious person and rolled themselves in
the folds of her full skirt, which performance hid
them from the view of anyone outside and as effectually
interfered with her movements.</p>
<p>But she had now caught something of their excitement,
and their appeal to her protection had
promptly banished her last trace of anger against
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I will, lambies, so I will. You just keep on a
steppin&rsquo; backwards and I&rsquo;ll do it, too, and first we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
know we&rsquo;ll get to that nice pantry where we stayed
last night. I&rsquo;ve got the key to that, even if &rsquo;tis
rusty from not bein&rsquo; often used, and I&rsquo;ll defy anybody
to get it away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still beating her eggs as if nothing uncommon
were happening, the housewife retreated toward
the door in question, and slipping one hand behind
her opened it without turning her head. She was instantly
relieved of the drag upon her skirts, and
quietly shut the door again upon her self-imprisoned
charges. Then she drew a long breath, and
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sharpshooter, what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if you couldn&rsquo;t have been so very hard
on them, else they&rsquo;d never come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-flatterin&rsquo; myself. That was a &lsquo;Hobson&rsquo;s
choice.&rsquo; But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they must have been badly frightened to
have done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ephraim, they are, and I am. I&rsquo;m so stirred
up I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ve beat these eggs all one
way, like I ought, or forty-&rsquo;leven different ones,
like I ought not. I&rsquo;m flustered. I&rsquo;m completely
flustered, and that ain&rsquo;t often my case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picra!&rdquo; sympathetically suggested the old man.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally&rsquo;s eyes snapped, and she smiled grimly,
as she retorted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picra&rsquo;s good for them &rsquo;at need it. That&rsquo;s you,
not me. It ain&rsquo;t a medicine for in&rsquo;ards so much as
&rsquo;tis for out&rsquo;ards. I mean, it&rsquo;s better for the body
than &rsquo;tis for the mind, and it&rsquo;s my mind that&rsquo;s ailin&rsquo;
me! Besides, doctors never take their own doses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it yourself! I thought your mind was
failing you, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing. I said, or I meant to say, I was
troubled in it. That&rsquo;s all; and if you&rsquo;re a mite of a
man you&rsquo;ll try and help me unravel this tangle and
quit foolin&rsquo;. Just step into that closet with me and
maybe the tackers&rsquo;ll tell you themselves. I&rsquo;d rather
you heard it first hand, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wun Lung, sifting flour in one part of the kitchen,
and Pasqual scrubbing a kneading board at the sink,
both paused and eyed the strange proceedings with
curiosity if not displeasure; for not only had the
children been bestowed within the &ldquo;cold closet,&rdquo; but
Aunt Sally and Ephraim had, also, followed and
locked themselves out of sight and hearing.</p>
<p>The pantry was absolutely dark, until Mrs. Benton
found a candle and lighted it; then she pointed
to the chair she had occupied during the night,
mutely inviting &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; to be seated. He
declined the proffered courtesy, so she sat down
herself, and it amused him that she had not once
stopped that monotonous whisking of the eggs,
though by this time the dish was heaped with their
frothy substance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cake you make of them should be light
enough,&rdquo; he remarked, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. There&rsquo;s such a thing as overbeatin&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;everything.
Well, laddies, we&rsquo;re all back in here
together again, and auntie wants you to tell Mr.
Ma&rsquo;sh where you got that candy; who give it to
you; what for; where you saw that sneaky snake,
Antonio Bernal; what you&rsquo;ve done with the staff
wand; and all the rest of it? &lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo; is a man
and a gentleman&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here the sharpshooter bowed profoundly, acknowledging
the compliment with a humorous expression;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
but the matron continued as if she had not
observed him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I know all about it, even if you wouldn&rsquo;t
tell. I&rsquo;m one has eyes on the back of my head and
on its top, too, I tell you, so you needn&rsquo;t try to think
I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s going on, for I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faces of her small listeners showed utter
amazement; then with one of his flashlike movements
Ned sprang to the back of her chair and
passed his hand rapidly all over her gray curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they, Aunt Sally? I can&rsquo;t find &rsquo;em. I
never saw &rsquo;em in all my life, and do&ndash;&ndash;do, please,
show them to me!&rdquo; he implored.</p>
<p>Luis scrambled up the other side, and echoed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never show &rsquo;em in m&rsquo;life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I don&rsquo;t keep &rsquo;em in exhibition,
but they&rsquo;re there all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally Benton!&rdquo; expostulated Ephraim. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
tell them wrong stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t a wrong story; it&rsquo;s a right one. If
they&rsquo;re not real, actual eyes, there&rsquo;s something in my
head takes their place. Might as well say &lsquo;eyes&rsquo;
as &lsquo;brains,&rsquo; I judge. But, be you going to answer,
Edward Trent? I&rsquo;ve got a prime lot of cookin&rsquo; to
do again, and no time to waste. &rsquo;Cause if you ain&rsquo;t
I&rsquo;ll just take Mr. Ma&rsquo;sh with me and lock you shavers
in here alone, where you&rsquo;ll be safe, but sort of
homesick. I shan&rsquo;t leave no candle burnin&rsquo;, for you
to set the house afire with. So you best tell, right
away, and then be let out to have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luis began to whisper, and beg:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her, Ned. Tell her. I hate the dark&ndash;&ndash;I do,
I do!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>Ned hesitated but a moment longer. He loved his
playmate as his own soul, and it altered nothing of
this childish David-and-Jonathan friendship that it
was as full of fight as of affection. Patting Luis&rsquo;
shoulder, he cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Course I&rsquo;ll tell, though if she knows it all
a&rsquo;ready&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know it, Ned. She wants you to tell
me. I&rsquo;m one of us, you see&ndash;&ndash;just we four,&rdquo; interposed
the sharpshooter, hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;well, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t anyhow. Only I saw&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;saw&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the child paused and peered cautiously
about.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh promptly sat down upon the boards
and motioned the lads to come to him, and when
they had done so, closed his arms around them, with
a comforting pressure, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now! We&rsquo;re as snug as bugs in a rug, and
nobody in the wide world dare harm you. Hurry up
and talk fast, or you and I will never get a taste of
that fine poundcake Aunt Sally wants to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another moment of hesitation, and then came
Ned&rsquo;s triumphant statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t no ghost, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered &ldquo;Forty-niner,&rdquo;
promptly agreeing, but considerably puzzled. He
had not, as yet, heard from any of the others about
the &ldquo;vision&rdquo; which Mrs. Benton had seen beside the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t nobody but &rsquo;Tonio himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I thought,&rdquo; he again agreed,
and encouragingly patted the boy&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And he come&ndash;&ndash;and he come&ndash;&ndash;and he gave us
one&ndash;&ndash;two boxes of that nice, nice candy; and all
we gave him was Pedro&rsquo;s old stick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Sally&rsquo;s egg beater fell to the floor unheeded,
this time she really put her spectacles in their
proper place and stared through them at the
narrator.</p>
<p>Ned warmed to his task and Luis cuddled beside
him, complacently adding his affirmative &ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; at
fitting intervals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so he said it wasn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;. And so&ndash;&ndash;and
so&ndash;&ndash;I fell offen the bookcase and made a noise; and
my mother didn&rsquo;t hear it &rsquo;cause she was asleep. Me
and Luis was asleep, wasn&rsquo;t we, Luis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. Sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he waked us up through the window&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waked froo winder, yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And said: &lsquo;Go get that pointed stick, Ned Trent,
and I&rsquo;ll give you a dollar.&rsquo; Didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme dollar. Didn&rsquo;t gimme dollar. What&rsquo;s a
dollar?&rdquo; asked the echo.</p>
<p>Ned went on, unheeding:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I said no. &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t my stick; &rsquo;twas my
mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Neddy, Neddy! if you&rsquo;d only stuck to that!&rdquo;
groaned Mrs. Benton, wiping her face with her
apron.</p>
<p>But being now fairly launched upon his narrative,
and also feeling wholly secure within the shelter of
&ldquo;Forty-niner&rsquo;s&rdquo; arms, Ned paused no more till he
had completed it:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And then he gave us the candy, &rsquo;cause I didn&rsquo;t
want dollars. You can&rsquo;t eat dollars, can you? And
the candy was like the kind my mother never gives,
and just for an old stick was older than Pedro. Huh!
And then he&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;he made me put my hand on the
top of my head&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands on tops of heads!&rdquo; cried the echo, dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And swore a swore I&rsquo;d never, never, honest
Injun, tell a single tell, else he&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;d kill me! Kill
me right straight down dead! And now I have and
he will, and I forgot and you made me! I hate you,
I hate you! And won&rsquo;t you feel bad when I&rsquo;m all
deaded and you you done it, &rsquo;stead of him&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sense of security had fled instantly, and completely.
The memory of Antonio&rsquo;s dark face as he
had stood threateningly before the little fellow, at
midnight by the window, returned with all its vivid,
terrorizing power. Springing to the farthest reach of
the room Ned crouched there, wide-eyed and trembling,
and, of course, Luis followed his example.</p>
<p>To &ldquo;Forty-niner&rsquo;s&rdquo; reassuring words, and to Mrs.
Benton&rsquo;s cajoling ones, neither child paid any
further heed. They had been trained to believe that
their promised word was the most sacred of all
things, and now they had not only been induced to
break that, but to break it in the face of Antonio
Bernal&rsquo;s terrible threat.</p>
<p>The elders left them to themselves and regarded
one another with regretful eyes. Then Aunt Sally
repeated in detail all that there was to tell concerning
the curious wand which had pointed the way
to wealth; and now Ephraim listened in vast respect.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
On the first recital, so hurriedly given by
Jessica, and when she had run to get the staff, he
had thought of the matter as one of the shepherd&rsquo;s
&ldquo;pious mummeries.&rdquo; It now assumed a graver
aspect. The lost staff might possess some magnetic
quality which was invaluable, as Old Century
believed; but beyond all that was the uncomfortable
reflection that Antonio Bernal was somewhere in
hiding about Sobrante, and that doubtless it had
been he, or his emissary, who had tampered with the
mail pouch and caused Marty&rsquo;s disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a man that hides must have somethin&rsquo; to
be ashamed of. And I believe every single word that
child has told,&rdquo; said Aunt Sally, in conclusion of her
long harangue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I thought that &lsquo;snake&rsquo; had had his fang extracted
down there at Los Angeles; but it seems he&rsquo;s
the sort can grow a new one, when needed. Well,
I&rsquo;m powerful glad I&rsquo;m home again. It takes a lot of
honest men to keep watch of one thief, and I&rsquo;ll
prove handy. I&rsquo;m off. I leave the lads with you. I&rsquo;m
going to find out three things: How Ferd, the
dwarf, managed to break jail that night and leave
no sign; who robbed that mail pouch; and where
Antonio Bernal is at this precious minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, at your service, amigo!&rdquo; cried a mocking
voice, outside the shuttered window. A voice that
all recognized at once as belonging to the late manager;
yet, when Ephraim had hastily run out and
around to that side of the house, there was nobody
within sight; and nothing to be heard save the
series of terrified shrieks which issued from the
room he had left.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>TAKING THE DOCTOR&rsquo;S ADVICE</h3>
</div>
<p>For almost the first time in his life Ninian Sharp
was under the doctor&rsquo;s hands; and that gentleman&rsquo;s
verdict upon his patient&rsquo;s case was simple and plain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing the matter with you but breakdown.
The result of doing two men&rsquo;s work instead of one.
What you need, and all you need, is a complete
change of thought and scene. Go off on some
ranch and take a vacation. That&rsquo;s your medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, doctor, but a prescription upon the
nearest drug store would be easier to fill. In the
first place I should worry all the time if I were idle,
for &lsquo;hustling&rsquo; has become my second nature. In
the second&ndash;&ndash;where shall I go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The physician shrugged his shoulders. He, also,
was a busy man and having finished his visit to his
patient did not prolong it. He picked up his hat,
remarked that he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t doubt so clever a young
man could find a fitting place, if he gave what was
left of his mind to it,&rdquo; and bowed himself out, leaving
the leaven of his sensible advice to accomplish
its legitimate result.</p>
<p>As the doctor left the room the nurse entered,
bearing with her a telegram which had been delayed
en route, and a letter. It was with some reluctance
that she delivered these to the man on the lounge,
yet realizing, at the same time, how much worse for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
him was absolute cessation of all his ordinary interests.
With a solicitous smile, she inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you not better let me read these first?
They are probably unimportant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no. I&rsquo;m not yet reduced to imbecility
and prefer to examine my own correspondence,&rdquo;
returned the invalid, fretfully. Then as if ashamed
of his petulance, and with a return to his ordinary
manner, added: &ldquo;This telegram might as well have
walked. Would have saved time, judging by the
date of it; and as for this letter&ndash;&ndash;that, certainly, has
seen better days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse smiled again, indulgently, and busied
herself in tidying the apartment; an occupation
which would have incensed Ninian, since her idea
of neatness seemed to him to be but the &ldquo;disarrangement&rdquo;
of the heaps of papers and manuscript
sheets scattered everywhere about, had he not been
otherwise interested. A hasty examination of the
messages he had received evoked his exultant exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! The very thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news?&rdquo; asked the attendant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best in the world. The doctor&rsquo;s prescription,
filled to the letter. A ranch and new business.
Say, would you mind going out for a bit? I&rsquo;d like
to get into some other togs and in a hurry. If I
can, I&rsquo;ll make the one o&rsquo;clock train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&ndash;&ndash;one o&rsquo;clock train!&rdquo; gasped the bewildered
nurse, believing that her charge&rsquo;s brain had given
away, even as the physician had suggested it
might do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Please don&rsquo;t be alarmed. Some country
friends of mine have invited me to visit them, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
I judge they would be glad if I accepted at once.
Their invitation fits in excellently with my own
needs and, after I&rsquo;ve dressed for the trip, I&rsquo;d be
grateful to you for packing a few things, while I
write to the bank and telephone to some other
places. Just touch that messenger call, will you,
please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly, he did not now look very like a sick
man, as he sprang up and looked about him; save
that he put his hand to his head because of a momentary
dizziness and seemed somewhat unsteady
on his feet. However, his eyes had lost their dullness
and a faint color had come into his cheeks; and
the attendant saw no reason for opposing his sudden
determination.</p>
<p>The letter was Jessica&rsquo;s, and its envelope had been
mended by the postmaster after he had taken it,
torn, from the mail pouch. The telegram was from
Ephraim Marsh, and had been sent by the first
messenger to Marion after that scene in the pantry
with Aunt Sally and the little boys. It had been
delayed by the curiosity of the operator, but had
reached Mr. Sharp at last; and its import was that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re willing to use your brains for Sobrante
folks, as you used them once before, now&rsquo;s the time.
There&rsquo;ll be a led horse at Marion till you come, and
the sooner the better. &lsquo;Forty-niner.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A led horse. Why, he must have forgotten, if
he ever knew, that I&rsquo;ve my own Nimrod here, that
Mrs. Trent insisted upon my accepting, when I left
Sobrante before. The horse must go with me, of
course, and I flatter myself I can pick up a bit of
instruction on riding among those fine &lsquo;boys&rsquo; of the
little captain&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll send a return message&ndash;&ndash;no, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
won&rsquo;t, either. I&rsquo;ll trust to luck and surprise them.
Now to get ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A feeling that he was going &ldquo;home&rdquo; possessed
the young man, and all his simple preparations
strengthened rather than weakened him. Activity
was his habit, and an hour before the train left the
city he had completed his personal arrangements
with his office, his bank and his landlord. He had
paid his nurse the same salary she would have received
had he required her services for the fortnight,
as expected, and was ready for what came next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I were entering upon a new life, instead
of taking a rest cure,&rdquo; he remarked to Mr. Hale,
when that gentleman met him at the station, and
explained that a Christmas invitation had come for
himself, also. &ldquo;And I say we&rsquo;ll make it the jolliest
holiday those people down there ever knew. I sent
a letter to your address, after I &rsquo;phoned, and made
out a list of things I&rsquo;d like you to see to. Presents
and so on; and I&rsquo;ll write as soon as I get there and
let you know what&rsquo;s up with the sharpshooter.
Some trouble, of course, but reckon it can&rsquo;t be
much. Ha! we&rsquo;re off. Good-by. Forget nothing,
add as much as you please to my list and send the
bills to me. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The train rolled noiselessly away from the long
platform, and the reporter for the Lancet stowed
himself comfortably away on his cushions and slept
as he had not slept before since this nervous illness
attacked him. Not once did he awake, till the conductor
touched him on the shoulder, and stated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;End of the line, sir. Time to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian sat up and shook himself, still feeling a
bit dazed from his heavy slumber, and had scarcely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
realized the fact of his arrival before a man limped
into the car and slapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, lad. Welcome to Sobrante!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mr. Marsh! You here? Sobrante? I
thought&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same thing. This is Marion; as near as we can
get to our place on the rails. Remember, don&rsquo;t you?
Been sick, eh? You look rather peaked and I &rsquo;low
I&rsquo;d ought&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apologies. Here I am, and am not ill now.
Only been a little overworked; and your telegram,
as well as Miss Jessica&rsquo;s letter, came in the nick of
time. Not an hour after the doctor had ordered this
very medicine of change and recreation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephraim looked sharply at his guest and reflected:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What our business needs is a clear head and a
strong body, not an overtaxed man, as this &rsquo;pears
to be. Well, sick or well, I hope he can see through
some of our muddles, if not all; and half a loaf is
better than no bread.&rdquo; Then he gathered the traveler&rsquo;s
belongings, and remarked: &ldquo;I told Aleck to
have a good supper ready. It&rsquo;s a fine night and I
thought we&rsquo;d ride home afterwards. Unless&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the car and Ninian answered the other&rsquo;s
unspoken suggestion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to stay all night, good as Janet&rsquo;s
beds are. I&rsquo;ve had a delicious sleep and feel like
another man from this morning. Hello! they&rsquo;ve
taken Nimrod out already, and evidently are waiting
for orders. I declare, the handsome beast looks
as if he recognized this place and was as glad to
get back to it as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>Old &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; left his guest&rsquo;s side and hurried
to the spot where a trainman held the spirited animal,
stroking its neck and speaking soothingly to
it, to calm its excitement; and no sooner had the
ranchman&rsquo;s hand supplanted the trainman&rsquo;s than
Nimrod ceased to prance, and with a little final
shiver, stood stock-still, uttering a low whinny of
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk, you beauty! Welcome home,
old boy! Well, well, well! if you ain&rsquo;t a sight to cure
the headache! Yes, yes; it&rsquo;s all right. This is
Marion. We&rsquo;ve got to stop at Aleck&rsquo;s first. Remember
Aleck? Remember Janet and her sugar?
Well, well, well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian approached, amazed and incredulous, inquiring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think that creature knows what you&rsquo;re saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; turned upon the questioner indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fool sort of question for a smart man to
ask! &lsquo;Think&rsquo; he knows? No. There isn&rsquo;t any &lsquo;thinking&rsquo;
in this. I know he knows, and I know he&rsquo;s just
as glad to set foot on his mother earth, here in
Marion, as I was t&rsquo;other day when I stepped off this
same train&ndash;&ndash;or its mate of the morning. I wish all
the men in the world were half as brainy as he is.
And I tell you what, stranger, you couldn&rsquo;t have
done a thing would make your own welcome so sure
as fetching Nimrod with you. If you&rsquo;d left him
behind some of us would have had our own opinion.
Though I, for one, didn&rsquo;t know he was yours till this
very morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the led horse you spoke about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephraim looked up, surprised, answering, rather
crisply:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;At home. Why not? When I heard about Nimrod
I wasn&rsquo;t silly enough to bring another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if I hadn&rsquo;t brought him we&rsquo;d been short a
mount?&rdquo; insisted the reporter, teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of us would had to foot it to the ranch, and
that one wouldn&rsquo;t have been me. Huh! Does me
good to hear your nonsense gabble again. I declare
it does. When did you get my telegraph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This&ndash;&ndash;morning! Why, I sent it day before yesterday,
no, the day before that. Let me see; to-day&rsquo;s
one, yesterday&ndash;&ndash;the funeral, two&ndash;&ndash;the one&ndash;&ndash;yes,
three days ago. John Benton himself gave it into
the telegraph man&rsquo;s hands. Himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They mounted and started toward McLeod&rsquo;s Inn,
Ninian doing very well, considering the impatience
of his steed and his own limited experience of the
saddle, and the sharpshooter sitting as composedly
upon the back of as restless an animal as could readily
be found. It was a bay, and pranced and curveted
to the extent that Nimrod seemed a door-mouse
beside it, and Ninian finally observed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an undecided sort of beast you have, yourself.
Seems to be as much inclined to go backward
as forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hale&rsquo;s. Name Prince. Was on the mesa with
Pedro till he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pedro dead? I&rsquo;m sorry. Was it his &lsquo;funeral&rsquo; you
meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Terrible pity he couldn&rsquo;t have held on till
Christmas, his Navidad, that always meant so much
to him. But he couldn&rsquo;t. Things have changed at
Sobrante since you was here. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come.
I&rsquo;m powerful glad you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Any new trouble, Ephraim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I should say. Ghosts, the women think,
and scamps for certain. But it&rsquo;s a long story, and
here we are at Aleck&rsquo;s. We mustn&rsquo;t spoil that good
supper of his and talk will keep. We&rsquo;ve thirty miles
&rsquo;twixt us and bed, &rsquo;less you change your mind and
stop here, and that should give time enough to turn
a man&rsquo;s mind inside out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you so certain of my coming that you
ordered a special supper, without hearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. I took you to be a man and I put myself
in your place. In your place I should have come if
I could; and if I couldn&rsquo;t I should have sent word.
Light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aleck came out to meet them, and Janet followed,
of course. Where one of that worthy couple was
the other was sure to be; and both extended to the
city man such welcome as made him more impressed
than ever by that &ldquo;home feeling&rdquo; which had possessed
him all day. He returned their good wishes
with heartiness and did full justice to his supper,
adding as a thankful tribute to Janet&rsquo;s fine cookery:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first thing has passed my lips that
hadn&rsquo;t the flavor of ashes, since many a day. The
doctor was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear any doctor ever could be right,&rdquo;
returned the innkeeper, who had never been ill, and
attributed his health to his distrust of physicians.
&ldquo;Fresh air, wholesome food and a clear conscience&ndash;&ndash;them&rsquo;s
to long life what the three R&rsquo;s are to
&rsquo;rithmetic. Powerful sorry you can&rsquo;t pass the night.
I&rsquo;d admire to talk over the political situation with
an intelligent man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The side glance toward himself with which the
Scotchman said this sent Ephraim off into a mighty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
guffaw, in which presently they all joined; and in
the midst of the merriment a stable boy led up the
horses, and the Sobrante-bound riders loped away.
Yet, just before they were out of hearing, Aleck&rsquo;s
stentorian voice sent after them the warning
advice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a sharp lookout, by, and your hands on
your guns. That spook&rsquo;s hit the trail again! Watch
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian laughed, and &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; tried to do so,
but the most he could accomplish was a feeble
cackle, which, his companion fancied, betrayed his
age as nothing heretofore had done. It was a nervous,
irritated laugh, and was matched by the
altered voice in which its owner presently remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t stop this fool business any other way,
I&rsquo;ve a notion to ride round the country and shoot
right and left, everybody I see, promiscuous. That&rsquo;s
the sure and certain way to hit the spook, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heigho! This grows exciting! Spooks? Mysteries?
Mail robberies! What next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer from the sharpshooter, who
had gotten his horse into a steady trot and was putting
the road behind him in a manner that needed
all Ninian&rsquo;s efforts to match. If Nimrod had been as
little used to the trail as his rider was to him the
space between the two animals would have widened
irretrievably; but he was the better bred of the two,
and though he didn&rsquo;t waste his strength in a first
spurt, as Prince did, he fell into a steady, easy gait,
that soon told to his advantage.</p>
<p>It was one of the perfect moonlight nights which
come in that cloudless region, when one can easily
&ldquo;read fine print,&rdquo; if so inclined, or see across country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
almost as well as in the day. The swift motion, the
exhilarating air, the sense of freedom from city
walls and cramped spaces, started the reporter into
singing, and later into the silence of wonder over
the astonishing power of his own voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! If that&rsquo;s my warble I never heard it
before! It&rsquo;s a marvelous atmosphere that makes a
rag time tune sound like a nightingale&rsquo;s music. If
&lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo; would join it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Hello! what&rsquo;s up?
What in&ndash;&ndash;the name&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;all things!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>NINIAN&rsquo;S GREETING</h3>
</div>
<p>Suddenly, out of the moonlit distance before
them, appeared a strange vision. A horse and his
rider, as spotlessly white and gleaming as the snow
on the distant mountaintops, moving toward them
as swift as the wind and in supernatural silence. The
eyes of the steed and its master glowed with a
wicked light that startled both the old frontiersman
and the modern scribe, and set Prince and Nimrod
into paroxysms of terror.</p>
<p>Rearing, plunging and backing, Ninian&rsquo;s mount
had him soon on the ground; and though Ephraim
stuck to his saddle like a burr; he could not hold his
horse and get at his revolver in that one instant of
the appearance and disappearance of this strange
&ldquo;specter.&rdquo; It was coming&ndash;&ndash;it was upon them&ndash;&ndash;it
was gone; and the blast of cold air with which it
passed them set the horses shivering in an ague of
fear, and tied the men&rsquo;s tongues.</p>
<p>It seemed an age that they halted there in the
open solitude, silently stroking and soothing their
frightened beasts, before either could speak. Then
&ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; found his voice and burst forth,
absurdly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat&ndash;&ndash;that&ndash;&ndash;pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian laughed; nervously, almost hysterically at
first; then with honest merriment, exclaiming:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a chance was lost there, comrade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, boy, whoa, I tell you! There, there,
steady now. Well, you needn&rsquo;t throw it in my teeth
if it was!&rdquo; retorted the sharpshooter, furiously.
&ldquo;Hang new pants!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian rolled on the ground and laughed afresh;
then feebly observed: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I generally do
with mine. But pockets! What of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! it&rsquo;s all very well for you to lie there and
snicker. I lost the chance of my life that time.
What&rsquo;s the use of a repertation for hittin&rsquo; a pin at
the distance I have if you can&rsquo;t hit a fool when he&rsquo;s
close alongside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Referring to me?&rdquo; asked the reporter, sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if the coat fits. Drat that pocket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor pocket! Who made it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That pesky Sally Benton. The one was in burst
right through, and she sewed this one so tight at
the top&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Huh! I believe she done it a-purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure she did. If I remember correctly that
estimable woman was opposed to bloodshed and
preferred corporal punishment. I suppose she feared
you might do what you attempted to do and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up your shallow talk, young man!&rdquo; ordered
Ephraim, with so much venom that the other realized
his mirth was ill-timed and grew serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the thing, anyway, Marsh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than I know, but just what I would
have known if I&rsquo;d hit it with a bullet. That&rsquo;s the
&lsquo;spook&rsquo; Aleck warned us of. It&rsquo;s been kitin&rsquo; round
the country ever since that first night after Pedro
died. Some say it&rsquo;s the ghost. It &rsquo;pears to be
wrapped in a white blanket and wears it same as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
did. He had a white horse once that had outlived all
the horses ever was, I reckon; and the Simple
Simons all about us claim that it&rsquo;s the Indian&rsquo;s spirit
on the Indian&rsquo;s horse, a-ridin&rsquo; round &rsquo;count of some
trouble why he can&rsquo;t rest. There was a letter thrown
into our settin&rsquo; room night before last, in poor
printing enough, too; and it said that Pedro had
been banished from the happy hunting grounds on
account of a secret he&rsquo;d told; and a warning everybody
not to touch to try and find the place the secret
told about. It scared the mistress pretty bad, though
she didn&rsquo;t let on much. The captain laughed, of
course. She always laughs at everything; and Mrs.
Benton&ndash;&ndash;well, she just pinned the paper in her
bosom, and says she: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll know where that is when
it&rsquo;s needed.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s some sense, Sally has, though
nothing to boast of, and she&rsquo;s a mighty good sewer
of patchwork, though she&rsquo;s no good at pistol pockets.
Well, shall we go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian had remounted his horse, which still was
restless and ill to manage, and Prince was capering
about in a fantastic fashion that, however, was not
greatly different from his behavior earlier in the
evening; and the reporter had satisfied himself that
there was nothing now to be seen of the apparition
which had flashed upon them and disappeared on
the road back to Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s go on. And I hope the least that will
happen will be the arrival of that &lsquo;spook&rsquo; at Aleck
McLeod&rsquo;s cheerful inn. I&rsquo;d give much to see his
face if it did appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s been there already; last night. The
kitchen window was raised so softly none but Janet
could have heard it, and before she could get to it,
a white, skinny hand came through and snatched up
a quail pie she&rsquo;d baked for breakfast and off sooner&rsquo;n
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
she could catch it. She was so mad about the
pie that, for a minute, she forgot to be scared; then
it came over her that she&rsquo;d been cookin&rsquo; ghost&rsquo;s
victuals, and she shivered all the rest the night.
She wouldn&rsquo;t ever let Aleck far out of sight, she&rsquo;s so
fond of him, but now he can&rsquo;t stir three foot away.
Every man I met has something fresh to tell of how
his women folks have been worried by the thing;
and if somebody doesn&rsquo;t settle his spookship mighty
sudden, we&rsquo;ll have all the females in hysterics; and
something we&rsquo;ve never needed in this valley yet,
and that&rsquo;s a doctor. There won&rsquo;t be a nerve left
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian laughed again; adding, a moment later:
&ldquo;Not just the sort of place to send a nervous-prostration
patient, is it, after all? But what&rsquo;s your
own speculation concerning the nuisance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you the whole business, so far forth
as I&rsquo;ve heerd it since I came home. Then you can
form your own mind on it and see how best to help
my folks out their troubles; &rsquo;cause I ain&rsquo;t trying to
hide that was my reason for wanting you to come.
You&rsquo;d helped us so much with the title affair I knew
you&rsquo;d unravel this skein. But I&rsquo;m powerful glad
to see you, all the same, and I do hope you&rsquo;ll get
as much good for yourself out the visit as I want
the mistress to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horses were now somewhat quieted by a
long stretch of the level road, over which they had
been allowed to travel at their own pace, and talking
was easier. Ephraim gave in detail the story
of Pedro&rsquo;s visit and gift of the wand; of the many
strange incidents of the last few days; of Ned&rsquo;s
serious illness, caused by fright, Aunt Sally declared,
but, as his mother thought, by too much rich
food and an overdose of candy; and how, though he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
had repeatedly been heard about the premises, nobody
had as yet actually seen Antonio Bernal. However,
at present, little was thought of but the suffering
children; for Luis had remained true to his character
of &ldquo;echo&rdquo; and had himself, that very day, been
put to bed with the same high fever which was tormenting
Ned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, though it&rsquo;s getting Christmas time and
everything ought to be lovely, we&rsquo;re about as badly
off as a family can be. All the same, if anybody in
this world can cheer the mistress it&rsquo;ll be yourself,
Mr. Sharp, and I&rsquo;m powerful glad you&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the rest of the ride they were mostly silent;
each man revolving in his mind the most plausible
explanation of Antonio&rsquo;s behavior, in his would-be
mysterious hiding, and his terrorizing of the little
lads.</p>
<p>Finally, Ninian expressed his own opinion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly natural he should drift back to
Sobrante, even with all the opprobrium that would
attach to him there. It is his home. He believed
or pretended to believe, that it was also his birthright.
He knows nothing that would bring him a
livelihood in the city&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except gambling,&rdquo; interrupted Ephraim, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he tried his hand at that even, he&rsquo;d fail. He
hasn&rsquo;t the head to plot deeply. His maneuvers are
all childishly transparent, and this last one&ndash;&ndash;h&rsquo;m!
Have you connected his &lsquo;highness&rsquo; with this spook
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; and you needn&rsquo;t. That Antonio Bernal
is the biggest coward above ground. Why, bless
me! even if he&rsquo;d had gumption enough to concoct
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
such a scheme he wouldn&rsquo;t have the nerve to carry
it out. He&rsquo;d be afraid of himself! Fact! No, siree.
Top-lofty never had a hand in this,&rdquo; answered the
elder man.</p>
<p>Ninian said no more but kept his suspicions revolving
in his own mind; yet was far more absorbed
in the possibility that &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; had suggested,
of the copper vein in the canyon, than by anything
else he had heard. They had ridden on again, each
silent, till the lights of Sobrante came into view;
then Ephraim remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon the little tackers ain&rsquo;t much better. The
mistress don&rsquo;t gen&rsquo;ally keep lamps lit as late as this,
&rsquo;less something&rsquo;s wrong. Oh! I hope there&rsquo;s no more
death and disappointment on our road. &rsquo;Twould
break Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s heart, indeed, if she lost Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian roused himself from his reverie, and answered,
lightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For such a cheerful fellow as I remember you,
even when you were first laid up in hospital, you&rsquo;re
degenerated sadly. What in the name of common
sense is the use of prognosticating evil, when good
is just as likely to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I&rsquo;m consid&rsquo;able older than you, young
man,&rdquo; retorted the sharpshooter, perversely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more reason you should be more hopeful.
What&rsquo;s happened to you besides these external troubles?
Something on your own account, eh? If so,
believe me you have my hearty sympathy and my
right hand to help you, if you need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ephraim checked Prince so shortly that the
animal reared on his haunches, and pushing his hat
from his brow regarded the visitor with a sad but
grateful countenance. Then he spoke, and his tones
were husky with subdued emotion:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, friend. I took to you the first time my
old eyes lit on you and I&rsquo;ve leaned on you, in my
mind, ever since. There is something &rsquo;at worries
me, but it&rsquo;s so slight I shan&rsquo;t put it into words&ndash;&ndash;yet.
I&rsquo;ve got work to do still for them I love and
that love me. Which I might maybe sum up in one
small person&ndash;&ndash;my precious Lady Jess. God bless
her! Ay, God bless her! From the crown of her
sunny head to the tips of her dainty feet, she&rsquo;s the
truest, squarest, tenderest creature the Lord ever
sent to lighten this dark world. They all love her,
every one of them rough, hard-handed sons of toil
whom she calls her &lsquo;boys&rsquo;; but there isn&rsquo;t one, not
one, can begin to love her as I do. Not one. It is
she that makes me still keep a little faith&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;There,
there! what an old fool I am! But, thanks, all the
same, and don&rsquo;t you forget I&rsquo;m your own to command
if need comes. Shake, neighbor, and may
your age be&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Giddap there, Prince! Let&rsquo;son,
lad; let&rsquo;s get on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian did get on, but again silently pondering
that here again was something mysterious in this
honest octogenarian&rsquo;s mood. There was an undercurrent
of sorrow which, he was sure, was wholly
distinct from the anxieties of his mistress and her
household, and he wondered what it might be.
Surely, for an old man, though wifeless and childless
he had much to make him happy. The devotion
of the family in which he had lived for so long, his
comfortable home, his freedom from care concerning
his future&ndash;&ndash;to the young man struggling amidst
a crowd of competitors to make a place for himself
in the world, it seemed as if the venerable sharpshooter
had cause for nothing but rejoicing. However,
these might be mere imaginations, and best
banished for the present.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>Ephraim made straight for the house, and the
sound of the horses&rsquo; footfalls brought figures flying
to the open doors; most welcome of these in the
eyes of the two men, the small one of Jessica herself,
her head stretched forth as she peered into the
night, and the lamplight behind her making a radiance
about her golden head and slender gracefulness.
But she poised there on the threshold only
for an instant, till she was sure what animals these
were, then darted toward them with uplifted hands
and a cry of delight:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve come! Oh, mother, they&rsquo;ve come!&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;ve
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another moment and the reporter had slipped
from his saddle and had caught up the little girl,
more glad on his own part than he would have
once thought possible to have her once more beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, captain, here we are! But did you expect
us&ndash;&ndash;or me? And how could you tell that we were
not strangers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you suppose I&rsquo;d know the step of any
horse for ours? And though Nimrod is yours now
I know him like&ndash;&ndash;like a brother. Don&rsquo;t I, dear
fellow?&rdquo; and from Ninian&rsquo;s clasp she ran to embrace
the down-bent head of the thoroughbred.</p>
<p>On his side, Nimrod was equally rejoiced. His
velvet nostrils caressed the little girl&rsquo;s cheeks and
flowing hair, while his dainty forefoot gently pawed
the ground in expression of delight and not impatience.
Prince stood looking on, unmoved. He
was not Sobrante raised and seemed to feel it; or
so Jessica fancied, as she left off petting Nimrod
and passed to Prince&rsquo;s side, to stroke his head also,
and to murmur words of praise for good behavior
in bringing Ephraim safely home.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>Then &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; led the beast away, while
Jessica sped after Ninian, who had been greeted&ndash;&ndash;almost
grasped&ndash;&ndash;by Aunt Sally. She had drawn
him indoors, laughing, crying, whispering, entreating,
all in a breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, oh, land of Goshen! My suz! If you
ain&rsquo;t the gladdest sight I&rsquo;ve seen this dog&rsquo;s age!
How are you, how are you? Slim? You certainly
do look slim,&rdquo; she declared, as she led him into the
radiance of the lamp and critically peered into his
face, both through and above her spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my good friend, I never was anything but
slim, as I remember. And I have been just a bit
ailing, if that&rsquo;s your meaning. However, I&rsquo;m all
right now, most delighted to be here, and wholly at
your service or that of anybody else who needs me.
How are the children? Ephraim said that they
were ill. And Mrs. Trent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in answer to his questions, there was a patter
of bare feet on the stairs and in came Luis, his
great dark eyes looking twice their normal size
and his voice shrill with excitement, as he tried to
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned&ndash;&ndash;Ned&rsquo;s gone and got&ndash;&ndash;and got&ndash;&ndash;Ned&rsquo;s gone
got gone roof. Oh, oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Benton dropped Ninian&rsquo;s hand which she had
continued to hold and shake up and down, much
in the manner of one pumping water, and caught
up the child to also shake him vigorously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! What&rsquo;s that you say? Don&rsquo;t you dare to
tell auntie a story. What&rsquo;s Neddy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Oh, my land!
all the catnip&rsquo;s gone out of my life, seems if!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter and Jessica looked at each other and
burst into laughter. It was impossible to help it,
Aunt Sally&rsquo;s manner had been so droll and yet so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
dramatic; and, oddly enough, over Ninian there
stole again the feeling that he had come home, and
that the griefs and perplexities of this household
had become his own. With that his merriment was
over, for the fear Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s face had betrayed
was sincere.</p>
<p>Jessica, also, had sobered instantly, and catching
her guest&rsquo;s hand hurried him impulsively upward,
crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done it again! Oh, if mother sees him it
will frighten her to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the upper floor and the end of the
hall which divided it into two sections, and from
whence a ladder ran upright to a trapdoor opening
on the sloping roof. The scuttle had been left open
for ventilation, and up this steep stairway Luis was
pointing with wild gestures.</p>
<p>Again Aunt Sally caught and shook the little
fellow, but he could make no better business of talking
than before. Jessica had not waited for more
than one glance into the empty chamber where the
sick children had been cared for, since it was more
quiet than the customary bed-room below; and
that glance, added to Luis&rsquo; gesticulations, told her
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s walking in his sleep again! He&rsquo;s gone
on the roof!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next the reporter realized she had climbed the
ladder and disappeared through the scuttle. He
forgot that he was, or had been, ill, and followed
her, only to pause at the sight which met him as
his head protruded through the opening. It was a
house of many gables, and upon the peak of the
farthest one poised Ned in his night-clothes, slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
swinging his arms in the circular fashion children
adopt preparatory to a leap or spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One!&rdquo; counted the childish voice. &ldquo;Two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian closed his eyes, as if by so doing he might
shut his ears to the final &ldquo;Three!&rdquo; which would
mark the fatal leap.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>JESSICA GETS HER WISH</h3>
</div>
<p>Ninian Sharp had closed his eyes against a catastrophe
which, seemingly, nothing less than a miracle
could prevent. When he opened them again
the miracle had been performed.</p>
<p>Love had lent to Jessica a strength and swiftness
almost incredible even to her active body, and she
had crossed the steep, slated roof just in time to
clasp Ned&rsquo;s feet and to drag him backward with her
as she rolled down upon the broader portion. Yet
even here was imminent danger, for the lad was
struggling, in his sudden awakening, and the pair
were slipping hopelessly toward the eaves.</p>
<p>But now was the reporter&rsquo;s chance and the test of
his athletic training. He threw himself prone upon
the slippery slates, worming his lean person over
them till he caught the girl&rsquo;s frock, and bidding
her &ldquo;hold fast!&rdquo; drew both the children slowly
toward the scuttle. When his feet had found the
edge of this the danger was past; and they were
presently down upon the hall floor, laughing and
sobbing together in one excited group. That is, the
sister was sobbing and Ninian was laughing in a
nervous way that had grown upon him with his
illness, and that told to Aunt Sally&rsquo;s keen ear how
really frail he still was.</p>
<p>But Master Ned, the cause of all this emotion,
looked calmly upon the stranger, and demanded:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that printing press you promised, hey?
I can say five, ten letters now, and I can spell cat
backwards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible? Before such erudition I bow my
humble head!&rdquo; laughed the visitor, grateful for
any, even nonsensical, words that would relieve the
tension of the moment.</p>
<p>But here Aunt Sally caught up the boy and looked
him over anxiously; then joyfully declared:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got his senses back. Oh! Gabriella, where
are you? Neddy&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, auntie, hush! There&rsquo;s no need to tell
mother anything of this last danger, and if you&rsquo;ll
only please put Ned back to bed she won&rsquo;t have
to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to bed. Been a-bed &rsquo;nough,&rdquo; protested
the supposed invalid. &ldquo;Want my clothes.
Want to go downstairs and get my supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get my supper,&rdquo; assented Luis, creeping forward
from the corner where he had hidden in fear of he
knew not what.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, echo! You on hand again? How&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;
demanded Ninian, drawing the child towards
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First rate,&rdquo; answered Ned, for his comrade, who
promptly echoed: &ldquo;&rsquo;Strate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now came the mother, hurrying up the stairs,
with a bowl of gruel she had gone to prepare, and
interest in which had opportunely prevented her
knowing either of the reporter&rsquo;s arrival or her son&rsquo;s
peril. And the visitor sprang to his feet again,
while she welcomed him as cordially and gracefully
as if she had been sitting in state, expectant,
within her own pretty parlor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>One flash of her eyes toward her boy, safe in Mrs.
Benton&rsquo;s arms again and carefully wrapped about
in her capacious apron, relieved any anxiety she
might have felt in coming upon this unexpected
group, and she asked, with a little burst of laughter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that Ned was so quick to welcome
you? Well, son, it might have been more courteous
to have gone downstairs; but I&rsquo;m sure our friend
will pardon a little lad who&rsquo;s been ill. He&rsquo;s really
better, isn&rsquo;t he, Aunt Sally? He looks quite
natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, honey, he&rsquo;s better. I reckon he&rsquo;s passed the
turnin&rsquo; point now, if nothin&rsquo; new sets in. You take
Mr. Sharp down into the settin&rsquo;-room, &rsquo;cause he&rsquo;s
seen the children and I&rsquo;ll set with them a spell.
Wun Lung can get the supper well&rsquo;s I can, if he&rsquo;ll
put his heatheny mind to it. Eh? What is it,
sonny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, Ned, like most sleepwalkers, was
wholly unconscious of his actions while in that abnormal
state, and made no comments on anything
save his own reluctance to go to bed while so interesting
a gentleman was in the house; but was
finally coaxed to do so by the promise of Luis
sharing his cot as well as his porridge; whereupon
Mrs. Trent kissed him good-night and invited the
guest below.</p>
<p>His protestations against another supper, after
the excellent one he had taken at Aleck McLeod&rsquo;s,
met with nothing but the hospitable rejoinder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but you can surely manage a light refreshment,
since you&rsquo;ve ridden thirty miles from Marion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which the little captain added her entreaties,
saying:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry, anyway. I&rsquo;m always so, I guess,
but I couldn&rsquo;t think of breaking bread before you
unless you share it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore sleepy Wun Lung came with the tray,
and was gratified by the friendly notice of the
stranger; and Mrs. Trent made tea in the little
swinging kettle over her alcohol lamp, her daughter
declaring that it always tasted better served in that
way. Ninian found that, in spite of his protestations,
the simple refreshments were very acceptable,
and the trio were quietly enjoying their reunion
when Jessica suddenly remembered Ephraim and
sprang up to go in search of him, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if Mr. Sharp isn&rsquo;t hungry, dear old &lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo;
is sure to be. He&rsquo;ll be here soon, maybe, but
I won&rsquo;t wait till the kettle is cold. He&rsquo;s been sleeping
at the &lsquo;house&rsquo; ever since he got back and might
go straight to his room, if I don&rsquo;t prevent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she had gone Ninian observed upon the
remarkable devotion between the old sharpshooter
and his small pupil, and the mother assented; yet
added, as an after-thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes regret it. Jessica is a child of impulsive,
yet absorbing affections. She can see no
flaw in the character of anybody she loves; and&ndash;&ndash;well,
none of us are perfect, and Ephraim grows
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, when he entered, the lady greeted him with
cordiality, and served him promptly; and presently
they were all talking eagerly of the recent events at
Sobrante. Of course, Pedro came in for a brief
but loving mention; and to the guest&rsquo;s inquiry as
to what had been done with the fine flock of sheep
which the old man had herded, the mistress replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sent them up into the mountains, with
the herds of a neighbor, for the present. Ephraim,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
here, petitioned for the post of shepherd, but I
dared not give it to him,&rdquo; and she looked deprecatingly
toward the sharpshooter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; assented he. &ldquo;She could trust
that Old Century, but she couldn&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was greater bitterness in the tone than
he had ever manifested before his small captain,
and she was quick to notice and resent it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, you blessed old grumbler, you stop
that, please. If not &lsquo;please,&rsquo; stop it anyway, because
I&rsquo;m your commander. You know why, and only
why, my mother said &lsquo;no&rsquo; to that bright scheme
of yours.&rdquo; Then she explained to Ninian, who was
listening closely: &ldquo;You must understand that shepherding
is the very loneliest thing that has to be
done on a ranch. The shepherd is alone from week
to week; on some ranches from month to month.
He hasn&rsquo;t a soul to speak to save when somebody
chances to cross his field, which isn&rsquo;t often. A lot
of men go crazy, living that way, and mother has
always been afraid for even Pedro. I never was for
him, though, &rsquo;cause he always liked it and had
lived so&ndash;&ndash;well, forever. But naughty old &lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo;
felt it would be his &lsquo;duty&rsquo; to go up there away
from all of us, and mother wouldn&rsquo;t let him, and
so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, my honored captain, you&rsquo;ll force me to
be a mere hanger-on and idler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessica held up her forefinger, warningly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
enough, Ephraim. I am &lsquo;She that must be obeyed,&rsquo;
Samson says, sometimes. And one of the times is
now. If you and mother aren&rsquo;t ashamed to disagree
before my dear Mr. Sharp, I&rsquo;m ashamed to
have you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All laughed and none took offense at this plain
talk which, jesting though it seemed, covered a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
serious meaning, and soon &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; remarked,
as if to close the subject:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all&rsquo;s said and done; yet, still, I know if
I&rsquo;d been let to have my way in this I&rsquo;d have stopped
a deal of mischief. It would be better, seems to me,
to have an old frontiersman living in Pedro&rsquo;s cabin
than a spook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent started, and, the guest fancied, shivered
slightly. But she rejoined, impatiently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Marsh! that nonsense again, and from
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they say, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cried Jessica gayly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing Sobrante needed to make it as
lovely as those old English places one reads about
in the story books was a &lsquo;ghost&rsquo;, and now we&rsquo;ve
got it! Honest, and I do hope you&rsquo;ll see it for yourself.
I want to so much, and one night Samson and
I chased it, but&ndash;&ndash;it got away. The &lsquo;boys&rsquo; say now
that it has even taken to horseback. Don&rsquo;t you
wish you might be luckier than I, Mr. Ninian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A glance flashed between the reporter and the
sharpshooter, but not quite swiftly enough to escape
the girl&rsquo;s observation; and, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I believe you have already seen it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an awkward silence, which Mrs. Trent
broke by the stern reproof she managed to throw
into one word: &ldquo;Jessica!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother, I know. It&rsquo;s silly, and I will be
careful not to mention the delightful subject before
the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you but a child yourself, my mature
little woman?&rdquo; demanded the visitor, playfully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m a little girl, of course; but one who
always wanted to see a fairy, till somebody told
me there was none. Now I&rsquo;m longing for this
&lsquo;spook&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;that really is, &rsquo;cause so many, many have
seen it&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m not even let to talk about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent shook her head regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve spoiled you among us, my
darling. But, leaving these unexplained things to
explain themselves at their proper time, suppose
you go and see that all is ready in Mr. Sharp&rsquo;s room?
Wun Lung is still mooning by himself on the kitchen
stoop and will do what you ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all do that, I infer,&rdquo; commented Ninian,
as the child hastened away, eager to serve all whom
she loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do. It&rsquo;s a delightful, but not, maybe,
the wisest life for any girl to live. No playmates
except her two small brothers, and no schooling
that is at all regular or effective. I can&rsquo;t imagine
what Sobrante would be without her, and yet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; took up her sentence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be Sobrante, mistress. That&rsquo;s all.
I, for one, couldn&rsquo;t stay here and serve under any
other body now except my captain;&rdquo; and so saying,
as if a shadow of the future fell upon him, the
old man rose and went out, quite forgetting to say
good-night.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jessica had found Wun Lung and
also found him more than willing to go with her
and perform even additional tasks, since by so doing
he might have the comfort and safety of human
presence. Fragments of talk had come to him in
his kitchen concerning the apparitions which had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
startled the whole countryside, during these past
few days, and had received the strongest confirmation
from his housemate, Pasqual. The latter believed,
indeed, all that he himself heard and invented
much more. He had grown to be afraid of his own
shadow and now resorted to the men&rsquo;s quarters on
each and every occasion that presented, feeling a
safety among them he could not feel at the &ldquo;house&rdquo;
among a lot of women. Of course, his defection
from duty entailed endless conflicts between himself
and Aunt Sally, but since this resulted in nothing
worse to the delinquent than a loss of some
dainty food, he could put up with it. He was away
now, bunking in Marty&rsquo;s room, and Wun Lung sat
alone, too afraid to go to bed, yet too uneasy to
enjoy the beauty of the night. His sharp, black eyes
peered here and there and everywhere, about the
place; and when Jessica came running to him, in
her noiseless moccasins, he jumped so high that
his queue flew out at a right angle from his head,
and he screeched:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mly flathe&rsquo;s, mly flathe&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Jess laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, good Wun Lung. Not your fathers, nor
even any of your relatives, but only me. Having
had supper, the next thing for our dear Mr. Sharp
is a bed and sleep. Come help me make it ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chinaman rose with alacrity, and soon had
collected the bed linen, towels and bucket of water,
suggesting that Jessica should bring a lighted candle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! we don&rsquo;t need a light, Wun Lung. It&rsquo;s as
bright as day with the shutters open, and we must
be quick, anyway, for the dear man has been ill and
is tired.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>The room was the same that Mr. Hale had found
so delightful during his own visit to the ranch, and
the girl threw the shutters wide, to let in the fresh
air and moonlight while they arranged the place
for occupancy. She left the bed making to the
longer and stronger arms of her assistant, but herself
attended to the pitchers and toilet things; and
while so engaged, with her back toward the open
windows, was suddenly startled by an ear-piercing
shriek from the Chinaman.</p>
<p>Shriek? Not one, but many; prolonged, reiterated,
till the whole house seemed in an uproar; and
facing swiftly about, to learn the cause and still the
clamor, Jessica found her lately expressed desire
completely gratified. For there, clearly distinct in
the moonlight, not ten paces from the window
whence she gazed, was the phantom horse and
rider!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>THE CACTUS HEDGE</h3>
</div>
<p>The shrieks ended by Wun Lung&rsquo;s throwing himself
face downward on the floor, but they had
roused the whole household, even the sleeping children.
Those in the room below had rushed to the
stairs, wondering what could possibly have happened
to the Chinaman, whose outcries these certainly
were. The little lads had sprang from their
cot, screaming on their own account, and Mrs.
Benton had awaked from the &ldquo;fortywinks&rdquo; she was
taking in her chair.</p>
<p>As a natural result of her sudden awakening she
grasped the two children who were clinging to her
skirts and shook them soundly, ordering them to
&ldquo;shut up to once &rsquo;fore you scare folks to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were not easily pacified and she thus, fortunately,
had her hands full, for the moment, else
the fear-paralyzed Wun Lung might have fared
hardly. As it was, none but Jessica had a full, clear
view of the strange visitant, since the Chinaman
had closed his eyes against it and the others had
not thought to look out of doors; but she saw it,
and with critical distinctness.</p>
<p>For an instant, indeed, her own nerves had thrilled
and her heart seemed to stand still; the next her
overpowering desire to see the &ldquo;spook&rdquo; for herself
had conquered her terror and she gazed with all her
might.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like Pedro, with his clothes
all white. And the horse&ndash;&ndash;it may be his that died&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghostly steed and its rider remained utterly
motionless, as if scrutinizing the house on their own
part or waiting for somebody to appear; then, as
the little girl bounded to the open window the better
to gratify her curiosity, the animal&ndash;&ndash;if such it was&ndash;&ndash;slowly
wheeled about and loped away. There
was a sound of muffled footfalls on the hard drive,
and the vision had vanished.</p>
<p>Jessica still leaned from the casement watching
and thinking more rapidly than she had ever done
before; but when convinced that the apparition was
really gone, she slowly retreated below stairs, passing
her mother and Ninian on the way, yet not
pausing till she had gained the side of the sharpshooter.
Him she seized, exultantly exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ephraim, I&rsquo;ve seen your spectre!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s no more a &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he demanded, hastily;
ashamed of himself for half regretting that the
supernatural view of the matter might not be the
right one. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t? Well, what is it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Antonio Bernal and his horse, Nero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! How do you fetch that? When both of
them are black as my hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her last, lingering uneasiness banished by his
presence and the sound of her own words, with
firmer conviction she declared to him and the others
who had now gathered about her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &lsquo;fetch it&rsquo; fast enough. This was the way dear
old Pedro used to ride; and this is the way your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
&lsquo;spook&rsquo; sat his horse,&rdquo; she announced, so vividly
mimicking both men that all who had known them
recognized the likeness, and Ephraim exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s them to a t-i-o-n-tion! Can seem to see
&rsquo;em right here before me. Well&ndash;&ndash;what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pedro wore his blanket like a king. Antonio
has covered his head with that white thing, and even
so wasn&rsquo;t half Pedro&rsquo;s height. I shall not soon
forget that splendid Old Century, the last time I
saw him ride away, that night. A hundred years
old, yet as straight in his saddle as a rod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antonio Bernal was a magnificent horseman,
darling,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Trent, from the chair into
which she had sunk, as if weakened by the series
of startling events which had befallen her home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, mother, dear, he couldn&rsquo;t match old
Pedro. Antonio sat forward, so, with a careless
sort of slouch&ndash;&ndash;just like the &lsquo;spook&rsquo; had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could possibly be his motive for such foolishness,
daughter, granting you are right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, mother, even you, as well as
Ephraim, seem sorry it isn&rsquo;t a truly ghost, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, indeed. I&rsquo;m sorry, rather, to think it
may be Antonio, as you fancy, and that he still persists
in troubling us, even by so silly a disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been so silly, Mrs. Trent, if it has hoodwinked
a lot of sensible people, and you are right&ndash;&ndash;there
must be a motive for it in the actor&rsquo;s mind. I
hope Jessica&rsquo;s judgment in the case is correct, for
back there in Los Angeles, we didn&rsquo;t find the manager
a difficult person to deal with,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Sharp.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>The girl went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that horse. Don&rsquo;t you remember, mother,
and you, Ephraim, the curious little switch Nero
used to give his tail whenever he was turned
around? Well, this &lsquo;spook&rsquo; horse did just the same
thing. Oh, I know, I know I&rsquo;m right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could he turn a black horse snow white,
even if you are? As I remember Nero he wouldn&rsquo;t
stand much nonsense, even from his own master,&rdquo;
said &ldquo;Forty-niner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! If lack-wit Ferd could paint Prince, as
he did&ndash;&ndash;another spirited horse, if you please&ndash;&ndash;Antonio
could do what he liked with Nero. It&rsquo;s paint,
of course, or something like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the eyes? The eyes as we saw them on the
road, a few hours back, were all on fire. You could
see them almost before you could make out that it
was a man on horseback was coming. Isn&rsquo;t that so,
Sharp?&rdquo; demanded Ephraim, persistent to the last.</p>
<p>Jessica turned upon him, triumphantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I knew from the way you two looked
when we were talking a little while ago that you&rsquo;d
seen something out of common! Do tell me about
it, please. Do, do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian laughed, glanced at his hostess&rsquo; face, and
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a story will keep, and you should be in
bed. I don&rsquo;t want to have my coming harm you
when I meant it to do you good. Even such a
courageous child as you ought to sleep a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been courageous, indeed, and had astonished
him by a coolness and readiness of observation
which would have done credit to a much older
person. He began to realize how different she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
from other children of her age, and how the hardihood
of her rearing had developed qualities that
were quite unchildlike. He wondered how she
would adapt herself to the habits and thoughts
of other girls of her own age, and was not surprised
that Mrs. Trent craved such society for her. He
wished that he might see her placed in some good
school, yet was doubtful if just the right one could
be selected for a pupil so different from ordinary.
However, that was not his affair, and to relieve the
family of his further presence at that late hour undoubtedly
was. So he bade them all good-night
and went to his room, and very shortly afterward
everybody under that roof was sound asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a dreamless, delicious rest I&rsquo;ve had!&rdquo;
was the visitor&rsquo;s waking thought. His next, that it
must be very late and that he had put his hostess
to unnecessary trouble. Then he turned over &ldquo;for
just one more wink&rdquo; and slumbered on for another
couple of hours. This time he had dreams in plenty;
and finally roused from one, of beautiful gardens
peopled by harmless &ldquo;spooks,&rdquo; to a sound of sweet
music. By his watch he saw that it was eleven
o&rsquo;clock and remembered that it was Sunday. Also,
the music was that of a familiar hymn, played upon
a fine piano, which was taken up and sung by a
choir of mixed voices, from the childish treble of the
two little lads to the stentorian bass of Samson,
the mighty.</p>
<p>Hastily dressing, Ninian slipped quietly down the
stairs and entered the sunny parlor; where Jessica
motioned to a chair which had evidently been reserved
for him, and softly approached him with an
open hymn book.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Trent at the piano and her rich
soprano voice faultlessly led her straggling chorus,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
filled for the most part by the men grouped outside
on the wide porch. He could see them through the
long, French windows, sitting or standing as each
felt inclined, but all with that earnest seriousness
of demeanor which befitted the day and the task.
For task it evidently was to some of them; John
Benton, for example. He stood alone, at the most
upright post attainable, his book at arm&rsquo;s length,
and his head moving from side to side, following
the lines, with a little upward toss of it as he reached
the end of each, while from his throat issued most
startling tones.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Aunt Sally explained, for she had
seen Ninian&rsquo;s amused survey of her &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John can no more carry a tune than he can fly,
and I&rsquo;d rather hear him sawin&rsquo; his boards than
tryin&rsquo; to sing. But he feels it&rsquo;s his duty to help
the others along by singing at it and sort of keepin&rsquo;
Gabriell&rsquo; in countenance, seems if. Sweet, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; in the guest&rsquo;s opinion&ndash;&ndash;the
whole of the short service; conducted with such
simple dignity and reverence by the Madonna-like
ranch mistress; the music so well chosen, the few
prayers so feelingly offered, and the brief exhortation
read from the words of a famous divine who
had the rare gift of touching men&rsquo;s hearts. And he
so expressed himself, as well as his surprise, over
the belated breakfast which Mrs. Benton served
him when the service was over and the household
dispersed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it&rsquo;s the nicest thing there is about
this dear Sobrante. There&rsquo;s always been the best
sort of inflooence here and that&rsquo;s why I like my
boy, John, to belong. Cass&rsquo;us, he used to hold the
meeting, and after he died I feared Gabriella
wouldn&rsquo;t be equal to it. But bless your soul! if down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
she didn&rsquo;t come that first Sunday &rsquo;at ever was, and
her not havin&rsquo; left her bed sence it happened, and
sent Wun Lungy out to have the old mission bell
rung, a signal. I&rsquo;ll ever forget it to my dyin&rsquo; day,
I shan&rsquo;t. Her like a spirit all in white and a face
was both the saddest and the upliftedest ever I see;
and them rough men all crowdin&rsquo; up to their places,
so soft you&rsquo;d thought they was barefoot &rsquo;stead of
heavy shod; and Jessie with her arms round the
two little ones, and her mother pitchin&rsquo; the tune,
same as usual, and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;I declare I can&rsquo;t keep
the tears back yet, rememberin&rsquo;. Before she was
done the whole kerboodle of us was sobbin&rsquo; and
cryin&rsquo; like a passel of young ones, and there was
she, with her broken heart, as calm and serene as
an angel. Angel is what she is, mostly; with just
enough old human natur&rsquo; in her to keep her from
soarin&rsquo; right away. Gabriell&rsquo;s one them scurce kind
makes you glad every time she does a wrong or
thoughtless thing, &rsquo;cause then you know she ain&rsquo;t
quite perfected yet, and you&rsquo;re surer of keepin&rsquo; her
&rsquo;on earth. My! the good that woman does beats
all. This very day, when she&rsquo;d lots rather stay to
home and visit with you, she&rsquo;s give orders for
Ephraim to have the buck-board got ready to take
her twenty miles to see a neighbor who&rsquo;s sick. She&rsquo;s
fixing a basket of things now, and is in a hurry.
So that&rsquo;s the reason she didn&rsquo;t come to keep you
company herself. Have another piece of chicken&ndash;&ndash;do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my breakfast
hugely, and feel as if I&rsquo;d never known a moment&rsquo;s
illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the sound of wheels just then and
Ninian strolled out to offer his service as escort to
the ranch mistress in case she might desire it. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
the offer was not made, though the lady greeted
him with evident pleasure, and even herself glanced
toward the vehicle, as if wishing he might ride with
her. But there was Ephraim Marsh, in the glory
of a white shirt and brilliant necktie, brushed and
speckless, and beaming benevolently upon all less
favored mortals. It was only upon such errands of
mercy that the mistress ever left her home, and
there was not a ranchman in her employ but esteemed
it an honor to drive for her whither she
would.</p>
<p>Ninian saw the state of affairs plainly enough,
and, possibly, so did &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; himself; who
might, under some circumstances, have sacrificed
his pleasure for that of the young man. But not
now. Ever since he had returned from his long
stay in the city, the sensitive old fellow had felt a
difference in his surroundings. There was nobody
mean enough to tell him of the base suspicions that
his fellow workmen had harbored about him, and
they fancied that by treating him with more than
former friendliness they could offset the unknown
injury they had done him. It was this very effusiveness
that had roused his suspicions that something
was wrong, and he saw in this solitary drive
with his beloved mistress a chance to unburden
his mind and get her wise opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>So he merely &ldquo;passed the time of day&rdquo; with the
guest, helped the lady to her place, and stepped up
beside her; then chirruped to his horse and was
off.</p>
<p>But Ninian was not allowed much disappointment,
for there was Lady Jess, clasping his hand
and looking up into his face with the brightest of
smiles, as she exclaimed:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
&ldquo;Just think of it, dear Mr. Sharp! We are to have
a long, delightful day together. Mother will not be
home before nightfall and I am to do everything
I can to make you happy. As if I wouldn&rsquo;t, even
without being bidden! But what shall it be first?
Where would you like to walk or ride? Or would
you rather rest and read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, I would like to walk around to that curious
hedge yonder, that you told me before had
been planted by the old padres. Everything about
these ancient missions interests me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I love them, too, and I&rsquo;m so glad we live
on one, or the place where one used to be. That
hedge is prickly-pear and was meant to keep the
Indians out of the inclosure, if they were ugly. But
it&rsquo;s a hundred years old, and Pedro could remember
when it was ever so much smaller than now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a weird stretch of the repellent cactus,
whose great gnarled branches locked and intertwined
themselves in a verdureless mass of thorns
and spikes which well might have daunted even an
Indian. The hedge was many feet in width and
higher than Ninian&rsquo;s shoulder, still green on top,
but too unlovely to have been preserved for any
reason save its antiquity and history. One end of
it was close to the kitchen part of the house, and
the other reached beyond the fall of the farthest
old adobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A formidable barrier, indeed! It reminds me of
some of Dore&rsquo;s fantastic pictures,&rdquo; said the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it? My mother has books with his
drawings in, and I have thought that, too. It is a
trouble sometimes, because anybody coming across
the field from yonder must go either way around
the quarters or all along the back of the house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
before he can get in here; when if it weren&rsquo;t there at
all, it wouldn&rsquo;t be two steps. But we will never
have it cut down because my father said so. He
wouldn&rsquo;t have anybody break a single leaf, if he
could help it, and&ndash;&ndash;oh, oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp lifted his head from his close examination
of a branch that had particularly interested
him and saw Jessica pointing in astonishment at
the very heart of the great hedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Something especially curious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious! It&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;dreadful! You can see
right through it! Somebody has ruined it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter stooped and followed the direction
of her guiding finger and saw that a strange thing
had indeed been done. For a considerable length
the terrible barrier had been literally tunneled,
though the fact was not easily discernible. Walls
of the bare and twisted branches were still left unbroken
on either side, but a sufficient space had
been scooped out to admit the passage of a human
being should such desire a hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! isn&rsquo;t that dreadful? Who could have done
it, and why?&rdquo; cried the captain, in distress; and her
companion could only think of Aunt Sally&rsquo;s declaration,
made to him at breakfast, that Sobrante was
&ldquo;bewitched.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>WHAT THE SABBATH BROUGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know how it was that Antonio disappeared
that time when Aunt Sally and Ephraim
heard him outside the pantry window!&rdquo; cried
Jessica, exultingly; and seeing the gentleman&rsquo;s puzzled
expression, told of the scene within the cold
closet and of the mocking answer &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo;
had received, when he said he was determined to
find out Antonio&rsquo;s retreat. Then she bade her friend
stoop again and see for himself how easy it was
for one at the rear of the house, where the pantry
was, to slip into this cactus tunnel and be utterly
hidden from anybody who would search from that
side.</p>
<p>They saw, also, that the broken branches had
been thrown under the open foundation of the
kitchen, leaving no sign of the ruin that had been
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clever scamp, indeed! And any other sort of
plant would have withered at the top and led to
discovery. But not this; for the verdure has evidently
long been gone from this part of the hedge,&rdquo;
observed Ninian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! This end has been dead for a great
while, yet my mother would not have it removed.
It would have lasted maybe forever in just that
way; and Antonio knew how we prized it. Oh,
dear! I do believe he is as wicked as the &lsquo;boys&rsquo;
say, though I hate to think that of anybody.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
&ldquo;Surely, you have had proof enough of his evil
doings, even without these later fantastic developments.
You must never trust that man, little girl,
should he again try to make you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he won&rsquo;t bother me. Why should he?&rdquo;
asked she, in some surprise, for her friend&rsquo;s tone
had been most impressive. &ldquo;Why should you imagine
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know myself, exactly why. It just &lsquo;happened&rsquo;
into my head. By the way, captain, did you
send me all of the specimen of copper that you
had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, indeed! My mother thought best not.
We sent you only a little bit, cut from the larger
one Pedro dug. Let&rsquo;s go into the office and I&rsquo;ll
open the safe and show you the rest. Do you know
anything about such mines and stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know something about ores and minerals,
my dear, for before I was a newspaper man I was
a clerk in the office of an expert in such matters.
I should greatly like to see your sample,&rdquo; he answered,
readily.</p>
<p>So she led the way at once and took the key
from a desk drawer, which anybody might have
opened, and Ninian remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an insecure place for a safe key! Yours
is certainly a most confiding household.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not a very safe safe, anyway,&rdquo; she
answered, laughing; &ldquo;and who would want to open
it? It&rsquo;s Ephraim&rsquo;s really, though I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s
ever been near it since he came home. Isn&rsquo;t it a
great, clumsy key? But my father told me that
there are safes much, much larger and stronger
than this which are opened by very small keys. Odd,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
As she spoke she was down upon her knees in
front of the strong box and trying with all her small
strength to turn the lock; and after watching her
for a moment the reporter laughed, and suggested:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you just merely pull at the knob. It
looks to me as if the thing were already opened,
for the door isn&rsquo;t tight; or is that protruding edge
of it a part of the general crudeness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessica obeyed, pulling with such unnecessary
force that the safe flew open and he fell backward,
laughing.</p>
<p>But Mr. Sharp did not laugh. In view of what
had been told him he was afraid the thing had
been tampered with, and watched in silence while
the little girl thrust her hand into the safe and felt
all about, her face lengthening as she did so; but
again, suddenly brightening, when she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my mother must have done that! There
was all the money in here that was left after Elsa
got her own share. The first nights two of the
&lsquo;boys&rsquo; slept in the house to watch, &rsquo;cause mother
was afraid we might lose it again. Then, since
&lsquo;Forty-niner&rsquo; got home only he has slept here, and
he generally &lsquo;bunks&rsquo; on the lounge in this very office.
That&rsquo;s what it is, what it must be. My mother
has worried about Antonio, and has taken the
money and the piece of copper away and put them
somewhere else. Well, never mind. She&rsquo;ll show it
to you as soon as she comes back; and now, what
shall we do next? Would you like to ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian passed his hand across his brow in mild
perplexity. An instant conviction had seized him
that here was another feature of the mysteries pervading
this peaceful ranch; and though he as instantly
frowned upon his own suspicion, it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
remain to torment him. However, he said nothing
further to disturb Jessica&rsquo;s composure, and readily
agreed that a ride would be delightful, though he
added, grimly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so lame and stiff already from yesterday&rsquo;s
horseback exercise that I feel older than Ephraim.
I expect a &lsquo;hair of the same dog&rsquo; is the best cure,
and wish now I had made time, back there in town,
to get used to a saddle. I never found it convenient,
though, and poor Nimrod missed his outings even
more than I did, I fancy. It certainly is a glorious
day for a canter, as almost all our days are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice, too, when the rains come. We do
things indoors then that we never do all the rest
of the year. My mother plays and sings half the
time, &rsquo;cause then she can&rsquo;t go poking around all
over the ranch, like she does now. In the evenings
the &lsquo;boys&rsquo; all come in and tell stories or do their
best to amuse us. We were always happiest, too,
when Pedro came, and when my father was here
he coaxed him and he came often. Now&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;ll
never come again!&rdquo; she finished, with an irrepressible
burst of grief, which she as quickly suppressed,
for she saw that it saddened her guest as well; and
she had been reared in the spirit of hospitality that
makes the stranger glad even at the cost of one&rsquo;s
own impulses.</p>
<p>So she added, with a smile that seemed all the
brighter because of the tears still glistening on her
long lashes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring you some books out here and you can
rest in the hammock while I run and have the horses
saddled. Buster isn&rsquo;t as fast as Nimrod, but he&rsquo;ll
go now and then as if he were a colt. I hope this
will be one of his fast times, don&rsquo;t you? I love
to ride fast!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
Ninian smiled rather grimly, answering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just at present, from the state of my poor
muscles, I fancy I&rsquo;d prefer a gait as slow as Buster&rsquo;s
ordinary one. But if I stay the week out, I mean to
learn a thing or two about that fine beast of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week or two! Why, you&rsquo;re to be here till
after Christmas, anyway, and that&rsquo;s a fortnight
off. I wish&ndash;&ndash;oh, I wish you would live here always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his delightful resting place in a hammock
that was &ldquo;stretched just right,&rdquo; and which commanded
one of the loveliest views in the world, he
looked afield and wished so too. Fond as he was
of his own active city life, this broad outlook appealed
to him most strongly; yet he shook off the
longing that assailed him to pass his days in the
country and opened the book Jessica had brought.
He was soon absorbed in its pages and forgot the
errand upon which the child had gone, till, after
a long time, as it proved, Ned stole bashfully up and
pushed a scrap of paper into his down-hanging
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, youngster!&rdquo; cried the gentleman, sitting
up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s timidity banished at the first sound
of the visitor&rsquo;s voice. Mr. Sharp reading, with his
spectacles on, and Mr. Sharp speaking in that hail-fellow-well-met
manner were two different people.
Besides that, Ned&rsquo;s shyness was not his strongest
feature, though it cropped out now and then to the
astonishment of his family. Also, he was fresh
from the hands of Aunt Sally and his catechism
lesson, into which she had adroitly forced a hint
of the conduct due toward a &ldquo;wise man, that can
write printin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
Supposing it to be a production of the little fellow&rsquo;s
own, Mr. Sharp delayed the reading of the
crumpled epistle he had received and continued his
talk with its bearer; who presently forgot his Sunday
manners, and reproachfully demanded that
&ldquo;printing press you promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause if I had it I&rsquo;d be just as smart as you,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smartersyou!&rdquo; cried the echo, clasping Ned&rsquo;s
neck with that choking affection of his.</p>
<p>Ned turned upon his other self and pummeled him
well, declaring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wouldn&rsquo;t neither, Luis Garcia!
&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be your printing press, and you can&rsquo;t
spell cat backwards! So, there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cat backwards, dogboycat,&rdquo; gurgled Luis, in a
rapture of mere existence.</p>
<p>Ninian laughed at the comical pair, finding them
infinitely diverting; and was only brought back to
his immediate duty by the insistence of the small
messenger, who demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you read your letter? I should
think anybody what makes newspapers could read a
little girl&rsquo;s letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact; I&rsquo;ll see if I can;&rdquo; and accordingly
spread out the scrap of wrapping paper, which had
not been very smooth to start with and had suffered
further ill treatment at Ned&rsquo;s hand. The note required
a second reading before he could fully comprehend
its meaning, which he then found sufficiently
startling to send him stableward in hot
haste. The message was from the little captain,
and was worded thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;dear mister sharp please excuse me i must go
to a Dyeing man and i Mustnt Tell Who cause if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
my mother was Home I Wood and she wood say
yes. She always helps dyeing folks and sick ones
one the boys will go and he can ride Moses or prince
Which he likes. I guess marty so i Cant right any
more the paper is so littul and i cant Stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;JESSICA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This had been written with a coarse blue pencil,
evidently picked up in the stable or workroom; and
to the reporter&rsquo;s inquiries, put to the first ranchman
he met, there seemed no satisfactory answer. The
man in question had not seen Jessica since service,
and the men&rsquo;s quarters to which Ninian hurried,
were almost deserted. Sunday was their own, so
the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; spent much of it afield, hunting or visiting
on neighboring ranches. Yet a further search
revealed John Benton, in his own room, reading;
and to him the visitor again put the question of
Jessica&rsquo;s probable whereabouts, and showed the
letter.</p>
<p>The carpenter was on his feet instantly, a look of
apprehension deepening the lines of his earnest
face; and running to the door he shouted to a stable
boy who was crossing the space before the old
adobes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natan! Natan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth paused, hesitated, yet came no nearer;
and John repeated his summons, with an imperative
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Then muttered an explanation to the reporter:
&ldquo;Another of those no-account Greasers;
same kind as the Bernals and hired by top-lofty
when, he was in charge. Works well enough
but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Natan had slouched forward and
stood stolidly awaiting an expected as well as
merited reproof, because of stalls imperfectly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
cleaned and harnesses left in other than their own
places; for John was orderly to the last degree and
a very martinet in disciplining his subordinates.
However, it was no neglect of duty that was now to
be scored, but a question was fairly hurled at the
young groom and in a voice sharp with anxiety:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natan, did you saddle Buster just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But yes,&rdquo; answered the lad, greatly relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he? And Nimrod?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nimrod is at the &lsquo;house&rsquo; horse block, is it not?
Si. Groomed to the highest, and a beauty we&rsquo;re all
glad to see back where he belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your opinion wasn&rsquo;t asked. Where is Buster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the captain wills. I know not, I,&rdquo; with
a shrug of his lean shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she mount him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why else should he be saddled, no?&rdquo; returned
the groom, with an insolent laugh.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s temper flamed and he turned away with
a disgusted snort, meaning to seek information
elsewhere on a case he felt permitted no delay. But
Ninian was cooler, if equally suspicious that Natan
was concealing something that should be known;
so, laying his hand not unkindly upon the youth&rsquo;s
shoulder, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know anything of this, where Miss Jessica
has gone and with whom, or if alone, it will be
worth your while to tell me and at once. I&rsquo;m pretty
good pay for seasonable articles,&rdquo; he finished, in
his journalistic manner.</p>
<p>He had taken a dollar from his pocket and was
carelessly tossing it from hand to hand, nor was
he disappointed when Natan fixed his black eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
greedily upon the coin. Still the lad said nothing,
only pondered in his own dull mind which of two
masters it would benefit him most to serve; and
annoyed by this hesitation, Ninian hazarded a guess:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you prefer to work for Antonio
Bernal, it&rsquo;s all one to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Natan&rsquo;s mouth flew open and his eyes grew wild:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it, then, already, you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know many things,&rdquo; was the sententious answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is a pity, yes. The so fine man and such
a rider. He will ride no more, poor Antonio, si.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian&rsquo;s blood ran chill, yet he asked, still quietly,
though foreseeing evil he dared not contemplate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who brought the word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ferd, the dwarf,&rdquo; came the reply, as the dollar
exchanged owners.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>ANTONIO&rsquo;S CONFESSION</h3>
</div>
<p>These were the facts: Natan had been grooming
the horses, Nimrod and Buster, when suddenly and
soundlessly there appeared before the window in the
stables&rsquo; rear, the misshapen head and shoulders of
typo Ferdinand Bernal. He was mounted on a snow-white
horse and seemed to the superstitious stable
boy to have risen out of the ground. Buster, also,
had appeared to be frightened for a few seconds,
though he speedily recovered his equine calmness
and merely whinnied his delight, while he attempted
to secure another mouthful of alfalfa before the
bridle slipped into place over his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natan, the little captain,&rdquo; whispered Ferd,
through the narrow casement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; the little captain,&rdquo; returned the other,
in a louder tone, and grinning at his own astuteness
in discovering that this was a white horse so
very like the &ldquo;spook horse&rdquo; that it might be one
and the same. Some of Antonio&rsquo;s schemes he had
fathomed, being himself a sort of schemer in his
own stupid way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want her. She must come. Antonio dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antonio&ndash;&ndash;fiddles!&rdquo; retorted the other, contemptuously.
Then saw, to his surprise, that Ferd&rsquo;s head
had dropped upon that of his strange steed and that
he was whimpering and sobbing in a pitiful fashion,
well calculated to deceive the unwary.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
It was at this juncture that, fancying to see her
beloved Buster made ready for her ride, Jessica ran
singing into the stable, and paused amazed at sight
of Ferd, weeping, and so oddly mounted. Horses
there were galore in the Sobrante stables and pastures,
but never one like this; so white, so spirited,
and yet so marvelously marked. For even by the
daylight, there in the slight shadow of the wall, the
animal&rsquo;s eyes glowed with an unearthly light, terrifying
to Natan and startling even to her fearless
self. Indeed it had not been until the moment of
her appearance and Buster&rsquo;s whinnied welcome,
that Ferd&rsquo;s horse had turned its face toward them
and revealed his curious visage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ferdinand Bernal!&rdquo; she cried, giving him
his full title, and thereby mystifying still further
the wondering groom. &ldquo;I do believe that&rsquo;s the
very creature that&rsquo;s been scaring such a lot of people
everywhere! How came you by it and what ails
its eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ferd lifted a face that was grimy with dirt and
streaked with tears. His misery was evident and
needed no words to impress it upon the tenderhearted
girl, who ran to the window, begging:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Ferd? Poor Ferd! are you
ill? In trouble? What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The death. It is the accursed house. Where
death comes once&ndash;&ndash;he is always there. He told me&ndash;&ndash;you
must come. Come; now, right away, si. Before&ndash;&ndash;too
late. He said it. Antonio, my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that, then&ndash;&ndash;about your relationship?
But what has happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf glanced at Natan and motioned to her
to send him away. For reasons of his own, the
groom was glad enough to obey, because dire had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
been the threats of the mighty-fisted Samson, as
well as the stern John Benton, against any on that
ranch who should be caught &ldquo;consorting with that
low-lived Ferd or the late manager.&rdquo; Besides, in
spite of Jessica&rsquo;s apparent indifference to the glowing
eyes of the white horse they infected him with
a horrible fear; so he made his escape at the first
chance; leading Nimrod around to the house and
tying him there to await Ninian&rsquo;s pleasure, while he
himself resorted to the most distant and safest spot
he could find. This had seemed, in his mind, the
mission corridor; but he found it already occupied
by a party of the ranchmen who had no desire for
his society, and after a short delay frankly told him
so. It was in passing from this ancient structure
to his own room in another building that he had
been intercepted by John, and called to account.</p>
<p>Yet, sometime before this, Jessica had finished her
interview with the unhappy Ferd; had written her
note of explanation to Ninian, though keeping her
destination secret, as the hunchback implored, in
accordance with Antonio&rsquo;s wish; had dispatched her
message by Ned and Luis; and, unknown to them,
had rapidly ridden away in company with the white
horse and her treacherous guide&ndash;&ndash;to comfort the
dying.</p>
<p>That death should have come again to the cabin
on the mesa, whither she was led, seemed natural
enough to her; remembering with such keen sorrow
the passing of old Pedro.</p>
<p>And for once Antonio Bernal had told the truth.
Lying helpless, almost motionless, on the narrow
bed in the shepherd&rsquo;s home, he greeted his visitor
with a pitiful smile on his white face, and a tone
from which the last vestige of his old bravado had
departed:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
&ldquo;The Captain! si. You did well to come, my Lady
Jess. But you are not afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be afraid, Antonio? You are ill,
I see that. What&rsquo;s wrong? What can I do to
help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. There is nothing. I played my game
and I lost. I&ndash;&ndash;I saw you last night at the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I saw you; I knew you; but I did not know
why you were fixed like that and had painted your
poor horse all white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! You saw that? You, when nobody&ndash;&ndash;older&ndash;&ndash;well,
I lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt? What can have happened to you
since then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot. On the way here, fearing nothing, a passing
horseman, unknown, braver or quicker than
the rest, thought he could rid the country of its
ghost. Ah, yes! it was merry&ndash;&ndash;for a time. It is
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessica was crying softly, unable to endure the
sight of agony, even his who had tried to injure her
and hers. The sick man perceived this and something
of the affection he had once felt for his master&rsquo;s
child, before he had betrayed that master&rsquo;s
trust, stirred him to speak and thrilled him with
compunction. He felt himself to be doomed; he
had already sent Ferd away again to summon a
priest; and according to his faith he meant to make
his peace with the world; but these preparations
had been on his own account only. Now he began
to feel something for her also.</p>
<p>Suddenly she ceased crying and stood up to bend
over him and beg that she might be allowed to
help him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
&ldquo;A drink of water&ndash;&ndash;some coffee? You were always
so fond of coffee, Antonio, and I know where
Pedro kept all his things. So many, many times
we drank it here together, he and I. And you&ndash;&ndash;how
came you here, Antonio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where better or nearer could I be? Pedro, the
most obliging, yes. Just when I needed his house
he left it. Si. Why, but I am better still, is it
not, I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed his color had improved and his voice
grown stronger since Jessica&rsquo;s arrival; and he was
able to take the cup of coffee which she made
him. This was more palatable than anything Ferd
had prepared and stimulated him still further. For
a few moments after he had taken it he felt so improved
that he almost gave up the doing of that
for which he had summoned her. But a sudden return
of pain again alarmed him, and as soon as
that spasm was past, he motioned her to the bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the cupboard&ndash;&ndash;look, quick!&rdquo; he whispered,
pointing to a set of shelves built upon the wall and
behind whose locked doors Pedro had been accustomed
to store his baskets.</p>
<p>Jessica tried the little door, which refused to open,
and to her inquiry for the key, Antonio pointed to
his own pillow. After a slight hesitation she approached
and secured the key from beneath it;
but when she had opened the cupboard found that
all the Indian&rsquo;s exquisite weaving had been removed.
In its place was the metal-pointed staff, with its
shank broken in half, and she exclaimed, indignantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! how could you do that, Antonio? And how
could you be so mean as to take it from two children?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Once it was all mine&ndash;&ndash;this land. The
copper in the canyon, mine, also. Si. The padres&rsquo;
secret which the shepherd kept was mine&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;No,
no; not yet!&rdquo; he broke off, with a sudden, delirious
scream, fancying he saw the head of a man appearing
without the door.</p>
<p>His outcry set Jessica shivering with fear at
being alone in that isolated spot with a possible
madman; but a second glance into his pallid face
restored her natural courage and assured her that
he was powerless to injure her, even had he wished
to do so. Just then, too, Buster whinnied and she
felt that he was company. It sounded as if he had
seen some stable companion of his own and had
welcomed it; yet this could not be, of course, since
nobody knew of her whereabouts or would be likely
to come to the mesa now. Therefore, she did not
follow Antonio&rsquo;s glance doorward, but sought at
once to relieve his distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you drink another cup of coffee, Antonio?
Or shall I make you a bit of porridge? There&rsquo;s hot
water still in the kettle and I know how. I&rsquo;ve made
it for my mother, often, when she was ill; and the
little boys always have it. Oh, I can do it quite
well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was so eager to serve him, and the pain had
once more so greatly lessened for the time being,
that the late manager graciously consented, and
with such an absurd assumption of his old &ldquo;top-lofty&rdquo;
manner that Jessica laughed even while she
hastened to put on the tiny porringer and seek the
meal. The little oil stove blazed merrily, and so
deft was she that, in a very few minutes more, she
had a dish of the steaming mush beside the cot
and had thinned a cup of condensed milk with which
to make it the more palatable. Sugar there was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
plenty, for Pedro had loved sweets; so that nothing
was wanted, save appetite, to render the repast all
that was desirable; yet when it was quite ready
Antonio could not take it.</p>
<p>The pain had returned and with added intensity;
and it was due to that fact that he no longer delayed
the confession he had sent for her to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! Behold! I talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Antonio, I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&ndash;&ndash;how begin? It is a story long, not
pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait. Open your mouth and I will feed you.
Yes, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His black eyes stared at her, astonished. In her
place had anybody done him the ill that he had done
her, he would have let his enemy starve and have rejoiced
at a suffering well deserved. But this child&ndash;&ndash;he
wished she would turn her face away, and not
look upon him with that innocent compassion. She
was too like her dead father, and his one best
friend; whom in life he had really loved and in death
had not scrupled to despoil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Antonio, eat. Afterward you&rsquo;ll be stronger
to talk,&rdquo; she said, as coaxingly as if he had been
her little brother, Ned; and thus persuaded, he
opened his mouth and received the morsel she forced
upon him. Thus it continued; she feeding, he resting
and with halting eagerness relating the story
of his own misdeeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I must go to pay the price. Si. But the
poor lad, my half-wit brother Ferd, ugly, sinful,
desolate&ndash;&ndash;he will be left alone. Is it not? For
him, if I restore all, there may still be kindness and
a home at Sobrante, that should all be his&ndash;&ndash;if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Antonio; you know better. That is a poor,
foolish notion that has been put into your head.
You know; for Mr. Hale, who is a lawyer and
understands everything like that, told you and us
that you hadn&rsquo;t a bit of right to a bit of land anywhere
in this world. Unless, indeed, you may have
bought it since that little while ago in Los Angeles.
And if you have, where did you get the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lo dicho dicho,&rdquo; he muttered the Spanish phrase:
&ldquo;What I have said I have said,&rdquo; and sighed profoundly,
as one hopelessly aggrieved.</p>
<p>Jessica lost her temper. She forgot that he was
ill and remembered only that he was imputing
treachery to her parents and to others whom she
loved, and retorted, warmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you have &lsquo;said&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t make the truth,
Senor Bernal. And if you have anything to tell me
I wish you would tell it now. I ought to be at
home with Mr. Sharp, who&rsquo;s come to make us a
visit. My mother is away, and it&rsquo;s rude to leave
guests alone like that. I, who want to be a perfect
lady, do hate to be rude. So tell, please, and quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was he, then, whom I saw on the road with
old Ephraim, yes?&rdquo; cried Antonio, in a voice which
was certainly much stronger than it had been when
Lady Jess arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was he. Now begin, please. What first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither the man on the bed nor the girl who listened
to him so intently suspected that other ears
were as eager to hear this dying confession. Yet so
it was, and Buster&rsquo;s short whinny of welcome had
been a real one. For John, on Moses, and Ninian,
on Nimrod, had lost but little time in riding to the
mesa; though because of the reporter&rsquo;s poor horsemanship,
the carpenter felt that they would really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
save time by taking the longer level road around
by the north, and not the narrow canyon trail, which
was dangerous for the inexperienced. This had
consumed some time, but each felt a thrill of relief,
when they at last arrived, to see Buster calmly
nibbling at the dry herbage near the shepherd&rsquo;s
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Buster is Jessica is, this time,&rdquo; said the
carpenter, softly. &ldquo;And I was right. I&rsquo;d heard of
this spook being seen up here, and fool folks layin&rsquo;
it to poor Old Century. That&rsquo;s why I came. We
didn&rsquo;t make any mistake, did we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as they approached nearer to the house
and quietly dismounted to hobble their horses, he
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up sly. Everything seems terrible still,
and I&rsquo;d like to take a peek through that back window
&rsquo;fore we let on we&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninian was not so cautious; or, rather, he was
more anxious about the little captain, and protested:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we know but that this silence means
mischief? If he has sent for her to harm her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! She&rsquo;s all right. Thank God for that.
I can hear her laughing, and he&rsquo;s a coward. She
isn&rsquo;t; and, anyway, he&rsquo;d think twice &rsquo;fore he hurt
a hair of that child&rsquo;s head. Why, man, his life
wouldn&rsquo;t be worth a minute&rsquo;s purchase if he dared!
He&rsquo;d be hunted to his own destruction so quick you
couldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;scat.&rsquo; Humph! He may be after mischief&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;cause
he hasn&rsquo;t been after anything else
since Cass&rsquo;us died&ndash;&ndash;but he&rsquo;ll keep within bounds.
Now, this way. Lucky the grass is thick; but even
so, don&rsquo;t tread too heavy. Right behind that rear
wall, close against the east, is the place to hear
all and not be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>Therefore, as noiselessly and hastily as possible,
they placed themselves within earshot of what
was said within the house; and the story they heard,
reduced to simplest facts, was to the effect, as
follows:</p>
<p>Upon receiving his discharge from legal detention
at Los Angeles, Antonio had felt a homesick longing
for his old haunts. He had returned without telling
anybody of his intention and had taken up his
abode at Solano&rsquo;s ranch, where his unfortunate
brother and the only person for whom he still cared
was frequently to be found. There the dwarf had
joined him, though rambling away again, from time
to time, on errands of his own of which he neither
spoke nor was questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money, money! That&rsquo;s the one thing, the only
thing, no! Get money, Ferd whenever, however,
wherever you can and what you get you keep. Hear
me,&rdquo; had been Antonio&rsquo;s constant instruction during
all the years of the hunchback&rsquo;s life; and to
the dwarf&rsquo;s limited understanding, his adored
brother typified incarnate wisdom.</p>
<p>He had anticipated high praise when, one day, he
came back to Solano&rsquo;s and reported his hiding of
the little captain in the canyon cave. The praise
was not so ready at first, for Antonio was astute
enough to see whither such a hazardous scheme
might lead; but the approbation came unstained
when, later, Ferd again appeared, describing Pedro&rsquo;s
behavior at the time of the rescue and of the curious
action of the ancient staff. Sent back alone
to bring fresh specimens of the mineral Pedro had
unearthed, Ferd had suddenly turned stubborn and
refused to go more than halfway. Pedro had died
suddenly, and Pedro&rsquo;s ghost would haunt the spot;
no, even Antonio should not compel him thither.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
He would do anything, everything else, but go to
the canyon cave again he would not.</p>
<p>Indeed Antonio now felt that it was hardly necessary
he should. The poor lad&rsquo;s superstition had suggested
a better way. With Solano&rsquo;s aid, the deluded
&ldquo;top-lofty&rdquo; hatched a notable scheme. He
would himself impersonate Old Century&rsquo;s uneasy
spirit, which could not rest because he had betrayed
the secret of the ancient padres. Nero could be
made as white as any ghost horse by the application
of a little paint; and shod with rubber could
pass over the sandy roads with almost as little noise
as any spectral steed. It was easy to bribe and
terrify two small boys into securing and restoring
to him the pointed wand, even if by their effort to
obtain it they might happen to fall and break it.
That mattered little, however, since the point was
all that he wanted; but it was just as well to have
that money he had seen through the window, that
night of his first appearance on Sobrante grounds.
That, too, was easy to get if one watched his opportunity
in that cactus tunnel Ferd had scooped
for his brother&rsquo;s convenience. An unsuspecting,
busy household left many chances for entering an
open-windowed room, and who had ever been so
familiar as he with the supposed safety secret place
in which the key was kept? With the money he
had found also the bit of copper Pedro had procured;
and he knew enough of mining matters to
rejoice, indeed. He had meant to do great things.
He would prosecute his land claim to the uttermost;
and there were plenty of unscrupulous men who
would undertake his cause for a share in the profits
of a copper mine. This very mesa would have been
the scene of their first operations. Here the mill
would have been built, and here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But what the use? The hand of punishment is
upon me, yes. The money, it is there. Ferd shall
tell of all the rest that he has put somewhere, I
know not. His poor brain cannot carry out the
plan, and to me it avails no more. Ay de mi! But
Solano&ndash;&ndash;beware. Of some things he knows, and of
more he suspects, is it not? Ah! I weary, I languish,
I die, I, Antonio Bernal, heir to wealth so
boundless. It was so fine a plan&ndash;&ndash;so most wonderful
and simple. The fools, how they feared! Oh!
the laughter I had! and the wild, rides on my so
splendid ghost horse, yes. But I die&ndash;&ndash;I die; and the
great big plan for the copper turned to gold&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;who
else will have the so great intellect, you call
it, to make it real? Well, I have done. The staff
I return&ndash;&ndash;useless, save to me. The money&ndash;&ndash;I cannot
carry whither I must ride on the white horse of
death&ndash;&ndash;whiter than&ndash;&ndash;the pity! The pity! Poor Antonio!
Poor, poor Antonio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His long talk had, indeed, wearied him to faintness;
but while his own tears rained down his
cheeks in his self-pity, even as Jessica&rsquo;s in sympathetic
sorrow, a cheerful and hearty voice cried
through the window:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret yourself, top-lofty! There&rsquo;s one or
two other smart men left, my friend, to carry out
that noble scheme of yours, and my name ain&rsquo;t
John Benton, if they don&rsquo;t do it! More&rsquo;n that, I&rsquo;ll
promise you a few more years to spend in wickedness,
if you like. On one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antonio&rsquo;s eyes almost leaped from his head in
amaze at this interruption and greater amazement
at this astounding promise; and John was swift to
press his advantage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll save your life&ndash;&ndash;on one condition!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>THE VERDICT</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Benton!&rdquo; warned Ninian Sharp, aghast at the
audacity of a man who would trifle with the apparent
death-hour of any man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s all right. Come around and in with
me. I never yet heard a voice as lusty as that from
a dying man, and I&rsquo;ve been acquainted with Senor
Bernal some little spell. He&rsquo;s scared nigh to death&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
just possible&ndash;&ndash;but he ain&rsquo;t sick nor wounded
to death, or I&rsquo;m mistook. Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessica met him at the door, and impulsively
threw her arms about them at her relief in their
presence. She had not been afraid of anything which
could harm herself, but she had believed the man&rsquo;s
own statement that he was dying, and his suffering
had been evidently intense at times. She had been
saddened and awe-stricken, and she now shared
Ninian&rsquo;s indignation at the carpenter&rsquo;s apparently
heartless promise. How was it possible for him
to bestow life where death had set its seal?</p>
<p>Nothing abashed by the reproachful looks cast
upon him, John walked straight to the bed and demanded,
in the most ordinary tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you hurt, neighbor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antonio caught at the straw the ranchman seemed
to extend, and feebly pointed to the wound in his
back.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>What followed astonished Ninian far more than
it did Jessica, who knew the carpenter&rsquo;s ways. As
tenderly, perhaps, because of his greater strength,
the old man lifted the injured one and critically examined
his wound; his face growing graver as he
did so, yet not losing its expression of confidence
and decision. When the examination was over, he
replaced Antonio on the hard pillow, which had
been Pedro&rsquo;s one luxury, and quietly replied to the
poor fellow&rsquo;s unspoken question, burning in his
great dark eyes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad job, my son. A mighty bad job, and
a sneaky one. I&rsquo;ve seen such before in my time,
and they didn&rsquo;t mean death. To some folks, though,
they meant what was worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody would now have recognized the voice
which uttered this dictum, it had become so infinitely
compassionate and gentle.</p>
<p>Antonio caught one meaning only: &ldquo;I will not
die? I need not die? It is you who will save me,
yes? O&rsquo;santos Dios!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had half risen from the bed, but now sank
back, exhausted by the shock of emotion as well
as by the physical effort; and Jessica sprang forward,
terrified by the sudden pallor of his swarthy
face. But John put her quietly aside and himself
placed a flask to Antonio&rsquo;s lips, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done your part well, my noble little
captain, and you&rsquo;ve done me proud. It&rsquo;s my place
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The senor soon rallied, and again fixed his eyes
imploringly on Benton&rsquo;s face, as he sat on the
edge of the bed beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, top-lofty, I promise to help you. But first
you must help yourself. You must pledge your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
word, the word of a dying man, that he dare not
break. You will restore everything that you have
taken from the mistress of Sobrante&ndash;&ndash;or anybody
else&ndash;&ndash;so far as it will hereafter be in your power;
you shall compel your Brother Ferd to guide a party
of prospectors to that secret spot in the canyon
where that piece of copper came from; and you
shall do all that it is possible to do for the good,
and not the evil, of your neighbors. That all clear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, yes, yes!&rdquo; whispered Antonio, frantically.
&ldquo;Haste! Oh, haste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-hasting, but I ain&rsquo;t a-hurrin&rsquo;. Which is a
good thing for you, &rsquo;cause so I can think this thing
over. That ball in your back will have to come
out. I&rsquo;ve taken some from folks myself, once or
twice, but this one is in a ticklish place. A doctor
is what we want, and the nearest one is ten miles
away on Kimball&rsquo;s ranch. He&rsquo;d rather potter with
his roses than other folks&rsquo; bullets, and I&rsquo;ll have a
tough piece of work to drag him up here, especially
to see&ndash;&ndash;you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an impressive emphasis on the word &ldquo;you&rdquo;
John paused, and waited some rejoinder. None
came, and though Jessica again exclaimed against
the carpenter&rsquo;s contemptuous tone, Antonio neither
resented it, nor felt it undeserved. Then Benton
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharp, here, is a writin&rsquo; fellow, and knows what&rsquo;s
what every time. In the jerk of a lamb&rsquo;s tail he&rsquo;ll
draw up a paper which&rsquo;ll explain what you promise,
and you&rsquo;ve got strength enough to sign your name
to it. The minute you do that I&rsquo;m off for Kimball,
and I&rsquo;ll fetch him up here fast as horses can travel&ndash;&ndash;if
I have to carry him on my back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! The paper! I sign&ndash;&ndash;I live!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Quick&rdquo; it was, and though Ninian was no lawyer,
he was always well provided with pads and fountain
pens. Also, he was clever enough to use the longest
and most impressive words wherever possible, and
thus convinced the senor that the document sounded
legally important. Indeed, the injured manager
could scarcely wait to affix his signature, so eager
was he that John should be off on his errand of
salvation.</p>
<p>An hour later the padre came, and Jessica led
Ninian away, that the pair might have the cottage
to themselves. Then, when this visitation was over,
the good man lingered, that he might hear for himself
the doctor&rsquo;s opinion when he should arrive. He,
too, had listened to another confession from the
truly repentant Antonio; but there was still a sacred
office to perform if this awaited opinion should be
for death, not life. But he had ridden far, and was
tired, having come directly from his own church
service at the distant mission, and Jessica&rsquo;s hospitality
could not endure to see the look of weariness
on the old man&rsquo;s kindly face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, Fra Sebastian, but would you like
a cup of coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! my daughter, would I like the impossible?
But, yes, I am famished, indeed, for the good dinner
of Marta, my housekeeper,&rdquo; he answered, with
a shrug of his plump shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, father, I cannot give you a dinner, but
I can make you a pot of fresh coffee; and in Pedro&rsquo;s
little storeroom are cans of meat, and beans and
biscuit. Oh! I tell you! I&rsquo;ll bring the plates out
here&ndash;&ndash;there are two whole ones&ndash;&ndash;and dear Mr.
Sharp and you shall have a picnic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already, with the light-heartedness of childhood,
she had almost forgotten the sorrowful errand upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
which she had come to the mesa. Besides, to her,
a thing that was possible was, also, probable, and
John would never have raised false hopes in Antonio&rsquo;s
breast. She was sure of that, and already
the senor&rsquo;s recovery a matter of but a little while.
Moreover, to serve others was her dearest happiness,
and though Fra Sebastian&rsquo;s faith was different
from her parents&rsquo;, she had been trained to know
all good people as the children of God. And he was
especially such, for his benefactions and self-sacrifices
were widespread, and he had been an honored
guest at her father&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I am so happy to do anything for so holy
a man, and I am so glad&ndash;&ndash;so glad we came!&rdquo; she
whispered to Ninian, tripping away to relight the
little stove and fill her kettle afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must be allowed to help, too, my captain,&rdquo;
he returned, eagerly entering into the altered spirit
of things; and so merry were they over their
preparations, so gay and bright the reverend guest
became, that Antonio was helped over his own tedious
time of waiting, and scarce knew how the
time passed before John&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>This was sooner than could have been anticipated.
The physician was already halfway on the road, intending
a neighborly call at Sobrante, when the
carpenter met and literally collared him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come you must, Dr. Kimball. I shan&rsquo;t take &lsquo;no&rsquo;
for an answer,&rdquo; was the decisive retort to the rose-grower&rsquo;s
prompt refusal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do nothing of the sort. I&rsquo;m not a practicing
physician now, and I never was a surgeon.
As for that scalawag, Bernal, if he&rsquo;s got himself
shot, he&rsquo;s met exactly what he deserved. Giddap!&rdquo;
he cried, to his horse, and was dashing past, just as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
John&rsquo;s long arm reached out and clutched the ranchman&rsquo;s
coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so much for him as for our Lady Jess.
You&rsquo;re not in such a tearin&rsquo; hurry, neighbor, and
if you are&ndash;&ndash;well, just let your hurry wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon, in a few brief, telling sentences, Dr.
Kimball was put in possession of the facts Antonio
had revealed, and had wheeled his horse about, with
a whimsical snarl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, forge ahead. For anybody named Trent
I&rsquo;d break my own resolutions a dozen times a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is probable that the kind-hearted man would
have gone anyway, even if he had ridden some
miles still farther on an opposite road. The knowledge
that somebody was suffering and needing him
was an appeal to his professional instinct he would
scarcely have resisted, but he had to make a protest
first.</p>
<p>All merriment ceased when he entered the cabin
on the mesa, and Jessica instinctively sought the
reporter&rsquo;s hand, needing his sympathy during the
anxious few minutes that ensued upon the doctor&rsquo;s
arrival. Fra Sebastian and John had followed the
surgeon indoors, but Ferd, who had brought the
priest to the upland, still remained within the deserted
fold, whither he had retreated as soon as his
errand was accomplished. To him death of any
sort, even that of an animal brought a horrible fear,
and nothing would induce him to leave his shelter;
till, when the conference was over, Jessica ran to
him, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Ferd! Oh, Ferd! He&rsquo;s going to live,
though, maybe&ndash;&ndash;maybe he will never walk again.
Come and see him, Ferd. He wants you. He needs
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>The dwarf came reluctantly, still adoring his
brother and still shrinking from him and the sight
of his agony. The examination had been painful, of
course; and the condition upon which life might
still remain a bitter one. However, it was&ndash;&ndash;life!
And to Antonio, at that present moment, that was
all he craved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make a litter or stretcher and take him
to the valley. He will need the closest care and
watching. He couldn&rsquo;t stay up here, and have a
single chance of recovery. Let&rsquo;s see, there are five
men of us, counting the dwarf. We&rsquo;ll have to walk
with the stretcher, and he shall lead the horses, all
but Buster, whom Jessica can ride. One at a time
he&rsquo;ll &lsquo;spell&rsquo; us, and the one released will take his
place at the beasts,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>So it was done. A blanket was speedily fastened
about two poles drawn from the corral, and over
these Pedro&rsquo;s hard mattress was laid; and thus,
placed as comfortably upon it as might be, Antonio
was once more conveyed to his old home at Sobrante.</p>
<p>And there, that Sunday night, was wild rejoicing
and much speculation concerning the outcome of
his confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharp&rsquo;s the man to put the thing in trim. He&rsquo;s
the very chap! He knows all about minerals, and
he says that this copper we&rsquo;ve struck is the very
purest article he ever saw! Hurray! Hurray! Three
cheers and a tiger for the Sobrante Copper Mine!&rdquo;
shouted the hilarious Marty.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there had been short but heated discussion
among her loyal henchmen as to whether
Mrs. Trent should be forced to receive and care for,
under her immediate roof, a man who had done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
her so much injury; and the decision had been unanimous:
&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even John, who had helped to bring him thither,
joined his voice to this assertion; and to the next
question propounded, as to who would attend him
and where, had as loudly answered: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Temporarily, the senor was resting in the household
sitting-room, but it was evident should not
long remain there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where then? Hate him as we may, we can&rsquo;t
let him die on our hands,&rdquo; said Samson, looking as
black as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fret yourselves, &lsquo;boys,&rsquo;&rdquo; said a cheerful
voice near the group. &ldquo;Mr. Ma&rsquo;sh and me, or
me and Mr. Ma&rsquo;sh&ndash;&ndash;for I had to put it to him pretty
plain, &rsquo;fore he&rsquo;d seed it right&ndash;&ndash;me and him will take
that misguided creatur&rsquo; into our hands, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the Lord have mercy on his soul!&rdquo; ejaculated
Marty, fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and Ephraim will &rsquo;tend him, turn and turn
about,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Benton, ignorant of Marty&rsquo;s
irreverent remark. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s to be put into Mr. Ma&rsquo;sh&rsquo;s
room at the quarters, and I&rsquo;ll take this first night&rsquo;s
job. I shall begin it with a dose of picra, and the
first page of the Westminster catechism; and if that
don&rsquo;t put him in good shape for the doctor and
Ephraim, in the morning, my name ain&rsquo;t Sally Benton,
nor never was. The doctor, he&rsquo;s rode home for
his instruments and such, and hopes to get the
bullet out in the course of time. But it&rsquo;s my opinion,
and his, too, I reckon, &rsquo;cause he didn&rsquo;t deny it
when I put the question plain, it&rsquo;s our opinion that
Antonio Bernal will never walk another step in his
life. But he&rsquo;ll live. He&rsquo;ll live everlastin&rsquo;. Them old
Californy folks always do. He&rsquo;ll simply be paralyzed
from his waist down.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></div>
<p>Despite their antipathy to him, a thrill of pity
ran through every one who heard her; and to most
of those stalwart men it seemed that this was a
punishment they could not have endured. Death
would have been far preferable to them.</p>
<p>So it befell that the late manager&rsquo;s fate was in
the hands of his enemies, so to speak; and while
Mrs. Benton and &ldquo;Forty-niner&rdquo; would faithfully
perform their duty toward him, they elected to do
it along lines of their own.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p>Events crowded one another at Sobrante.</p>
<p>Under the compulsion of his brother&rsquo;s will, so
soon as that brother was able to think of anything
beyond his own suffering, Ferd led a party of the
ranchmen, with Ninian Sharp at their head, to the
canyon cave and the pit where the little captain
had been imprisoned. They shuddered as they beheld
it; yet could but rejoice that Old Century had
sought her there, and had, so opportunely, revealed
its precious secret. They also took good care to
blaze their path as they went, for it was most intricate
and bewildering. They had the curiosity
to test the powers of the wonderful staff, which
John had carefully fitted with a new top, and were
amazed at its curious behavior, as it zigzagged over
the floor of the almost unsupported. Whatever the
metal, or compound of metals, on the point, it was
certainly attracted by, and indicated the presence of,
copper in the earth beneath.</p>
<p>Returning to the house after this trip of exploration,
Marty was promptly mounted upon the &ldquo;ghost
horse&rdquo; Nero, and sent to Marion with telegrams for
Ninian&rsquo;s expert friends in Los Angeles, and to bring
back the mail. The unhappy animal had been
treated to a liberal bath of gasoline and soap suds,
and had come out of it a sort of mongrel; but with
the phosphorus gone from about his eyes and face,
and with a reasonable prospect that he might some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
day be restored to his original ebony hue. Yet his
spirit seemed broken, as if he had felt the disgrace
of the part he had been forced to play in the late
escapades of Antonio and his fellow-conspirators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what one might call the irony of fate that the
man who caused the death of Comanche should thus
be forced to supply Comanche&rsquo;s place with his own
beloved Nero,&rdquo; commented the reporter, as the messenger
rode away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Things generally do even up in this
world, if a body has patience to wait a spell,&rdquo; answered
Samson. &ldquo;And though I&rsquo;ve no love for him,
and wouldn&rsquo;t trust him across this plaza, without
watchin&rsquo;, I can&rsquo;t help pitying poor &lsquo;top-lofty,&rsquo; and
thinking he was more fool than knave. The idee!
Them plans and performances of his savor more of
the &lsquo;middle ages,&rsquo; that I&rsquo;ve heard about, than of
these days. But it just takes my breath away to
think of what Sobrante will be, some time, if that
&lsquo;find&rsquo; in the canyon turns out what we imagine.
Why&ndash;&ndash;but there! No use talking. Wait and see.
How long you think before you get an answer back
from the town, tellin&rsquo; what your friend&rsquo;ll do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I expect Marty will bring that answer. He&rsquo;s
to wait an hour or two, you know, and give a chance.
If Cornell&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s the expert&rsquo;s name&ndash;&ndash;is in the city,
he&rsquo;ll probably come himself by the evening train.
In that case, you and I might drive over to meet
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh-e-w!&rdquo; ejaculated the ex-sailor, astonished.
&ldquo;You newspaper fellows beat the world for hustling,
don&rsquo;t you? So quick as that? H&rsquo;m! If you fly as
much sail as that so sudden, looks like we&rsquo;d reach
port ahead of time.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When a thing&rsquo;s to be done&ndash;&ndash;why, do it! If there&rsquo;s
copper enough to pay for mining, why&ndash;&ndash;mine it,&rdquo;
answered the other, coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, mining costs money. Talkin&rsquo; is
cheap,&rdquo; retorted Samson, sententiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. One must put in a little capital if one
expects to get results, in any business. The money
will be found easily enough. Trust me to see to
that. Or my friends and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the journalist was as eager as possible on
this new matter. His brief rest had restored his
overtaxed nerves, and he was more than ready to
push any enterprise that commended itself to his
keen judgment. Now, all depended upon the expert&rsquo;s
arrival at the ranch. He would then be taken in
person to examine the discovered vein, and on his
opinion great affairs would depend. Yet Ninian felt
that even if Henry Cornell&rsquo;s opinion was averse, he
should not let the subject rest there. He would
consult with others. Mrs. Trent&rsquo;s interests must be
forwarded to the utmost, and no possible chance of
her realizing a fortune lost through any lukewarmness
of his own.</p>
<p>Marty duly returned. He brought the expected
message from the great expert, and that gentleman
would arrive at Marion by that very evening&rsquo;s train.
He brought, as well, several letters for the ranch
mistress, and these Jessica joyously carried to her
as she sat quietly sewing. Most of them were business
communications, which were promptly read
and laid aside, to be answered at once; but there
was one which the mother dropped in her workbasket
unopened, though it was the thickest and
plumpest of the lot, and, also, bore the postmark
&ldquo;New York.&rdquo; In ordinary, all New York mail was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
the most eagerly read of all that came; and this
fact caused Jessica to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, dear! Why don&rsquo;t you read it? Or
are you like me when I have something extra nice
for dinner, leaving it to by and by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, darling, I&rsquo;m leaving it&ndash;&ndash;a while. It will
keep. I know what is in it, or nearly so. It&rsquo;s not
the first of the sort has come lately, and I&rsquo;ll have
courage soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage, mother? Do you need courage to read
your letters? What harm can come to us now, out
of that far away city? My father&rsquo;s name is cleared,
we owe nobody, we&ndash;&ndash;why, we may be going to be
very, very rich, if things turn out as Mr. Ninian
thinks they will turn out, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Oh, dear! I&rsquo;m
not saying it very clear, only seems to me we ought
to be perfectly, perfectly happy now; and if there&rsquo;s
anything bad in the letter, please give it to me, and
let me burn it up right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, the mother caught her daughter close
within her arms, kissed her passionately, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, little captain! If you go so far from me,
how shall I live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;go so far&ndash;&ndash;from you!&rdquo; repeated Lady Jess,
in utter astonishment. &ldquo;Why, what can you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trent recovered her composure, even smiled&ndash;&ndash;if
not very gayly&ndash;&ndash;and answered, tenderly:
&ldquo;Whatever come, my sunshine, remember that, of
all things, your mother desires your welfare before
her own. But more than that I cannot tell you now.
So, run to Aunt Sally, dear, and ask if she can be
spared from her nursing a few hours. I think one
of the other men will relieve Ephraim, if he is tired,
in waiting upon Antonio. I want she should help me
get up an extra fine supper for Mr. Ninian&rsquo;s friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
Ah! my child, how much we owe to that young
man&rsquo;s goodness and enterprise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, indeed, we do. But seems to me we do
nothing but cook here, nowadays. It&rsquo;s always company,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And glad I am of that. So long as the larder has
anything in it, I love to share it with&ndash;&ndash;friends. Not
strangers, who do not care, but with anybody else,
the best we have. If a luxury well; and if but a
crust, still well. Now&ndash;&ndash;to Aunt Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jessica guessed that as soon as she was out of
sight the disagreeable letter from the other side of the
continent would be promptly read, and wondered
not a little concerning its contents. And she was
right. Mrs. Trent had barely finished its perusal,
when Mrs. Benton appeared, but from her the
mother had nothing to hide. She looked up quietly,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another more urgent entreaty from old Cousin
Margaret. She puts the matter so strongly as my
duty that I&rsquo;m compelled to acknowledge she is&ndash;&ndash;may
be&ndash;&ndash;right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! She&rsquo;s been wrong enough, sometimes,&rdquo;
returned Aunt Sally, peevishly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when she
got angry with you for marrying Cass&rsquo;us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was mostly from indignation at losing me,
her one loved relative. There could never have
been a kinder guardian&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor a queerer, as I&rsquo;ve gathered from your own
talk. I never saw Margaret Dalrymple, and I never
want to. Anyhow, nothin&rsquo; can be done at present;
but I&rsquo;ve brought one comfortin&rsquo; word across from
the quarters with me, Gabriella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Aunt Sally? Is Antonio better?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! bother Antonio. He&rsquo;ll get well, of course.
That kind always does. Of that I never had a misdoubt.
The word is this, and I begin to think that
old Fra Sebastian may be a real Christian, after all.
He not only offers, but he says it must be this way:
As soon as &lsquo;top-lofty&rsquo; can be safely moved, he wants
him to the sannytarium to his mission. Him and
Ferd, the dwarf, likewise. He says them old Californys
all belong to him, and he will look after them.
Antonio is to be in the sanny-house, and Ferd is to
be put into the mission school. Though he&rsquo;s a man
in years, he&rsquo;s a child in learning&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;cept evil. So Fra
proposes to oust the evil if he can&ndash;&ndash;I wager he&rsquo;ll
find he&rsquo;s got a job&ndash;&ndash;and put in good. He&rsquo;ll make
Antonio earn his keep a-writin&rsquo; up the books and
accounts, for, with all his silliness, he&rsquo;s a master
hand at figurin&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;for himself. So that settles them,
and don&rsquo;t you dast say no to the arrangement when
it&rsquo;s perposed to you, Gabriella Trent, or I&rsquo;ll never
let you hear the last of it. It&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s own way
of disposing things, and a better one than I could
cipher out, if I do say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly Mrs. Trent had no objection to make to
so comfortable a settlement of a perplexing question;
and in due time the Bernals left Sobrante forever;
and of their lives at the mission those whom
they had known so long were henceforth to hear
little, &ldquo;and care less,&rdquo; according to the satisfied
ranchmen.</p>
<p>Mr. Cornell, the expert, came, inspected, reserved
his opinion, and departed; but Ninian Sharp had
gathered enough from the visitor&rsquo;s few sentences,
idly dropped, to feel quite convinced that the thing
was worth carrying farther. So he, too, left Sobrante;
but, after a brief sojourn in Los Angeles,
reappeared, in company with Morris Hale and a
trio of prospectors, representing much capital. All
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
this was very exciting to the simple household; and
Mrs. Trent, at least, felt infinite relief when, on the
eve of Navidad, there were left in it only those two
strangers, who had now become less strangers than
familiar friends.</p>
<p>Gathered about the fireside, which the first of the
rainy nights made doubly enticing, the New York
lawyer discussed at length the decision which the
prospectors had made. They considered the mine
well worth working. &ldquo;In fact, I have reason to believe
it will turn out one of the richest in the whole
country. They are willing to advance all money
needed upon certain conditions,&rdquo; and he named
them.</p>
<p>These seemed extremely liberal and just to both
sides, but Mrs. Trent did not greatly surprise her
listeners when she quietly interposed a clause to the
effect that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband believed in profit-sharing. It was
his ambition to put Sobrante and its various interests
into such an operation. I want all our &lsquo;boys&rsquo;
to enjoy the benefits of that which God has given us.
They will contribute their labor and share in its
results; share richly if I can have my will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your will is doubtless law, madam,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Hale, courteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the mine is worked, I want our dear
friend, Ninian Sharp, to come here and act as its
manager, on behalf of the Sobrante side. He&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she
raised her hand gently, as he started to interrupt&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;he
must be paid a much larger salary than he could
earn upon the staff of the Lancet, and would have,
I hope, sufficient leisure time to use his pen in
other literary work, such as he tells me he has never
had the chance to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>For the first time in his life, maybe, the alert
reporter was taken off guard, and hadn&rsquo;t a word to
say, except the very ordinary one of &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;;
but he said it, bending over the lady&rsquo;s hand, and with
such an expression of delight upon his thin, intellectual
face, that no greater eloquence was needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Aunt Sally, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time to begin
that there decorating which Gabriell&rsquo; thinks is a
part of Christmas. Pasqually&rsquo;s been real good. He&rsquo;s
been up to the dreen, where you planted them calla
lilies, Jessie, and he&rsquo;s fetched a good many bushels.
Seven hundred, I guess he said. And he&rsquo;s cut poinsetty
enough to turn us blind with its redness; and
my boy, John, hitched up and went along under the
flume and druv his pushcart back full of the biggest
maidenhair ferns and sweet brakes I ever see. So
now, youngsters, set to and trim. Then we&rsquo;ll hang
up our stockings, every one; and I&rsquo;ll give you the
nicest Christmas dinner can be cooked, if I have to
cuff Wun Lungy into basting them turkeys as they
ought to be basted. Come, Neddy; come, little
Echo; I saw Santy Claus&rsquo; wife&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s me, shove a
pan full of gingerbread men into the wall oven, and
if they&rsquo;re done, I&rsquo;ll give each of you a soldier of
dough to drive you to bed. Stockings first? Of
course, of course. Why, what would Christmas be
without its stockings? Here&rsquo;s a brand-new pair
auntie&rsquo;s knit for you, one a piece; and if you don&rsquo;t
find &rsquo;em stuffed with rods in the morning, it won&rsquo;t
be because you don&rsquo;t deserve it, you precious, precious,
naughty little lambs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off went the good creature, a boy on either arm,
her patchwork streaming behind her, her spectacles
on the top of her head, and her ruddy countenance
as beaming as if she were, indeed, that mythical
person&ndash;&ndash;Santa Claus&rsquo; wife.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>Oh! what a Christmas followed! With everybody
from far and near who had any claim upon Sobrante
hastening thither to share its open hospitalities;
Wolfgang and Elsa, with their &ldquo;little&rdquo; six-foot son;
the genial McLeods, Dr. Kimball and his sweet-faced
invalid sister, Louise, for whose benefit he
had left their fine Boston home to live in this lonely,
lovely southland. These, and many more, not only
came, but did such justice to Mrs. Benton&rsquo;s and
Wan Lung&rsquo;s cookery that, as she said, next morning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land suz! There ain&rsquo;t scraps enough left to
make a decent soup, even! But never mind, we had
a royal time, every single soul of us. Christmas is
over, and I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s so well over. Now, we can
settle down and rest a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, there was rest for the household itself,
but for Ninian Sharp and his coadjutors. The mining
scheme was rapidly put into practical operation;
Mr. Hale lingering all that winter to further its
interests, and to enjoy what he had coveted early in
his acquaintance with it, a few months of ranch
life at ideal Sobrante.</p>
<p>Then came the glorious springtime, when the mesa
was alive with flowers; the canyon was fragrant
with perfume, and the whole countryside became
an earthly paradise. The springtime, when the
Easterner could no longer delay his homeward trip,
nor Mrs. Trent the revelation of what her New
York letters had contained, though Jessica had
almost forgotten them.</p>
<p>One week before the lawyer was to leave them,
mother and child sat, hand in hand, beside the
father&rsquo;s grave, whither the widow had purposely
withdrawn, as if the precious dust within might
still support and counsel her. Taking the little captain&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
hand in hers, and speaking as calmly as if her
heart were not desperately sad, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, when Mr. Hale goes home to New
York you will go with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother! Oh! Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is right. My Cousin Margaret, whose
letters you have seen me read, sometimes with ungrateful
tears, offers you a home and an education.
She was a mother to me in my youth, and I owe
her much. Now that she is old and desolate, she
begs for you. It may be that I should still have
declined to please her at so much pain to&ndash;&ndash;us, but
the discovery of this copper mine of ours, and the
fact that you will one day be one of America&rsquo;s richest
daughters, forces me to comply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, why, mother? Why should that matter?
I&rsquo;d rather give it up. Say no! Oh, please, say no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot now. I dare not. Upon your dear
shoulders will rest a great trust and responsibility.
You must be fitted to discharge that trust by the
best education possible. This education you cannot
gain here. You must seek it elsewhere. We must
not make it harder for each other, this bitter parting,
but we must bear it bravely for&ndash;&ndash;father&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus ended Jessica&rsquo;s early childhood; and of what
befell her in that widely different life at school it
must be left to another volume to relate.</p>
